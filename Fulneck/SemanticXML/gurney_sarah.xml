My Parents <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the <lb/>
					<orgName type="anglican">Church of England</orgName> wherein I was <eventName type="baptism">Baptiz'd</eventName> &amp; brought up. In my Childhood <lb/>
					I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must <lb/>
					attain to something at yet unpossess'd, or I could not be saved.  My natural diss- <lb/>
					position was flighty so that what <name type="emotion" key="tender">tender</name> impressions I had in my heart, <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> <lb/>
					of short duration. When I was <date cert="medium" when="1758">13 years old</date> a Discenting Gentlewoman took <lb/>
					me into her family, where I was instructed in <del>those</del> <add place="above">the</add> principles <add place="above">of that denomination</add>; I read their <lb/>
					Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which <name type="emotion" key="frighten'd">frighten'd</name> <lb/>
					me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour'd <lb/>
					to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading, <lb/>
					praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer'd before those of the <lb/>
					E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In <date when="1730" cert="high">1730</date> my <lb/>

					&amp; therefore kneel'd down by his bed, read &amp; pray'd by him, putting the Bible <lb/>
					into his Hands, when he open'd to that portion of Scripture, Remember <lb/>
					thy <roleName type="honorific">Creator</roleName> in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may <lb/>
					not be hid from thine Eyes. This <name type="emotion" key="so affected me">so Affected me</name> that I immediately rose up, <lb/>

					but lived in all the <name type="emotion" key="gayeties">gayeties</name> of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions, <lb/>

							<del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney <lb/>
							I have to add the following</del>: Since I came into the <affiliation type="single_sisters_choir">single sisters</affiliation> house <lb/>
							at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003" cert="high">Fulneck</placeName> the <roleName type="honorific">Holy Ghost</roleName> took me into his school, &amp; showed me that <lb/>
							I ought to <name type="emotion" key="love">love</name> our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> more than I did &amp; that I had not that <name type="emotion" key="earnest">earnest</name> <lb/>
							<name type="emotion" key="desire">desire</name> which I should have for the manifestation of his <name type="emotion" key="love">love</name> to me. Though <lb/>
							he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity <lb/>
							poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular <lb/>
							manner, I was in <name type="emotion" key="darkness">darkness</name> sometimes through unbelief &amp; the <name type="emotion" key="feeling of my misery">feeling of my
<lb/>
misery</name>, &amp; if it one not for his <name type="emotion" key="love">love</name> &amp; <name type="emotion" key="pitty">pitty</name> he would have taken his <name type="emotion" key="grace">grace</name> from</p><p><lb/>
							me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly <lb/>
							that without him there is <name type="emotion" key="no happiness">no happiness</name>, I felt my lost estate but he drew me <lb/>
							near to himself &amp; did not let me <name type="emotion" key="rest">rest</name> till I could by <name type="emotion" key="faith">faith</name> apply his <add place="above">Atone</add> <lb/>
							ments <add place="above">to myself</add> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been <lb/>
							more faithful to his leading I should have experienced <name type="emotion" key="more happiness">more happiness</name> &amp; have <lb/>
							been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness <lb/>
							&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but <persName type="real" cert="high">Jesus</persName> <name type="emotion" key="comforts">comforts</name> me, who out <lb/>
							<name type="emotion" key="mercy">mercy</name> free me all my <name type="emotion" key="guilt">guilt</name> with <name type="emotion" key="patience">patience</name> in the accursed tree. Now my <lb/>

							<name type="emotion" key="melted">melted</name> so that each one felt it how I <name type="emotion" key="love">love</name> that Man. May his <name type="emotion" key="love">love</name> be <lb/>

							<del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can <lb/>
							never <name type="emotion" key="praise">praise</name> <add place="above">him</add> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child. <lb/>
							His <roleName type="honorific">Holy Spirit</roleName> often reproved <add place="above">me,</add> but when with <name type="emotion" key="contrition">contrition</name> I <add place="above">owned all</add> to him, he <lb/>
							<name type="emotion" key="forgave">forgave</name> me again, In short I live by his <name type="emotion" key="forgiveness">forgiveness</name>. He <del>I was</del> <add place="above">cared</add> for me <lb/>

							<del>which alas I have often done</del> <del>by he</del> <add place="above">and tho' I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he</add> my great <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> still remained the same <lb/>
