      <h2>Abigail Bentley</h2>
      <p>The course of Life of <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000219.html">Abigal Bently</a><br></br>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000102.html">Wike in the Parish of Barstel</a> <em>April y<sup>e</sup> 23<sup>d</sup> 1722</em><br></br> my Parrents was of the Church of England and brought me up in the <br></br> same, as far as I can remember my first thought of being saved was thro'
         						<br></br> hereing my Mother speak with another what time Children begun to be anser <br></br> able for Sin and they thought at Seven-years, this had such an
         							impression <br></br> on my mind that I often went alone and wish'd<a href=".html">God</a> wou'd let me die before that <br></br> time for then I took it for granted I should be saved, <em>when I was about Seven <br></br> Years</em> I began to be afraid of dying, my Parrents strove to preserve me as far <br></br> as
         						there circumstances permitted them, <em>in my Eleventh year</em> I was sent to live <br></br> with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad things
         						had not our <br></br> dear Saviour had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul <br></br> and Body, when I was there they
         						sent me into a Feild to work where I was <br></br> so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Feet nor could I come to any <br></br> House, all on a sudden it
         							came in my mind that <sup>God</sup> could warm me and I grew <br></br> directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot <a href=".html">God</a> could here us <del>or know </del><br></br> or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a <br></br> nother <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and intended <br></br> to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a
         						constant <br></br>condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own <del>words</del><sup>writing</sup><br></br> about this time she began to hear <a href="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/data/personography.html#mlper000536.html">Mr
            							Igham</a> and when the societys of <br></br> the B<sup>rn</sup> was sitled <del>she</del> was one of the first of that number when
         						the <br></br> S S<sup>rs</sup> Oconomy was seteld at <a href="#mlpla000121.html">Oxhaire</a> she after some time had
         						<br></br> leave to be one of them where she continued for <del>some time</del><sup>a while</sup> but her being <br></br> of a very Leagal turn made it very <sup>heavy</sup> for her amidst
         						of the Sisters</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>*<em>In the year 42 Nov<sup>br</sup> y<sup>e</sup> 13</em> she was reciev'd into the congregation<br></br> and as it coud not be perciev'd that she got any satisfaction in <br></br> her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for
         						her to go and <br></br> live with two or three Sisters who' was under the B<sup>rns</sup> care which <br></br>
         						she took very much to heart and could hardly be persuaded to do as <br></br> was however thought for the best <del>and</del> she took it
         							so very near that <br></br> it brought on a violent sickness for <sup>us</sup> she her self
         						express &amp; it <br></br> coud never bear to be Defard of the fellowship of living in the <br></br> midst of Sisters, and yet at the same she was in her heart very <br></br> dry and her being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very heavy<br></br> for her to fell as a Sinner depart alone upon our Saviour and <br></br> this has been ameans of her course being some what heavy in the <br></br> Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place <br></br> to place to place by the direction of the
         								B<sup>rn</sup> when at last she got <br></br> leave to go and live with some Sisters at the Home where she <br></br><del>at</del> began to feel a little more of her self and was brought <br></br> in to very great concern about her Salvation but as she was</p>
      <p><br></br> once coming from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to <br></br> her Heart, Out of pure grace unmerited, Salvation show'rs <br></br> on our Head Merely because the Lord had dy'd, Because a Lamb <br></br> was Crucify'd,
         						Are we invited to possess a Throne, Before the <br></br> World was made ordaind our own, and she was from this time made <br></br> sure of her Election * when the Choir House was
         						begun at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a><br></br> she with some others Out of the Oeconomys got leave <del>from Briard</del><br></br><del>Mortimer</del> to remove with them to that in <a href="#mlpla000090.html">Pudsey</a>, but here it <br></br> she did not spend her
         						time so chearfully as could have been wish'd</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro' looking so much <br></br> at others and being so very
         						strict with her self she could not <br></br> easily look over things that some times accord amongst her compan <br></br> ions, yet at the same time we cannot denigh but as to her
         						true <br></br> Heart to her Choir and the Cong<sup>n</sup> we was fully persuaded which <br></br> show'd it self evedintly on various occasions, <em>in the year 1754</em><sup>where in 54 she had the grace to be </sup><br></br> July The <a href="#mlper000566.html">Diciple</a> and <a href="#mlper000701.html">Diecpless</a> pay'd a visit to the Cong<sup>n</sup> and this <br></br> the earnest request of the Sister of that Ocemomey to come into <br></br> the Choir House at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a> the <a href="mlper000566.html">Diciple</a> took it into con <br></br> sideration and it was made out that the said Oeconomy
         						should <br></br> be entirely broken up, and so she with the rest of her Sisters<br></br> came here into this House where she continued very chearfull<br></br> for some time and cou'd not express her self enough of
         						the joy<br></br> She felt that she was now got to her right home, but thro' <br></br> her very strict way of thinking she brought her self into <br></br><del>many</del>great heavyness and deprivd her self of the Holly Communin for some <br></br> time she spoke with her
         						Laboures in avery open hearted manner<br></br> of her whole situation and it was plain to be percevd that she <br></br> must be dealt with perticlar love and tenderness which her Labours <br></br> show'd to her at at that time and it was a great means of bringing <br></br> her to a clearness again in her Heart<em>in the year 1763</em>complan <br></br> ing much of a pain in her Head she was advisd to a Cold Bath <br></br>
         						which removed the pain in her Head but soon after it was percived <br></br> that the desorder
         							seteld upon her Loungs and she was much <br></br> troubled with a voilent Cough, but in a short time
         						grew better again <br></br> and it was made out that she shou'd go for some time into the </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>Childrens Oeconomy<del>Washahi</del> Wash Kitchen where she showd the <br></br> greatest faith fullness, but thro' the desorder in her Lounge she <br></br> was oblig'd to be
         						taken back again, and she her self believd that it <br></br> would prove a means of her disolution thus she continued in a pritty chearful<br></br> way and was made use of as an over seer in a Work Room and it <br></br> was the greatest favour to her to do any thing for her Choir
         						and never <br></br> thought any thing too much but on the contrary lookd upon it as the <br></br> greatest grace and favour, <em>Sep<sup>br</sup> y<sup>e</sup> 16<sup>th</sup></em>she had the favour to be <br></br> added amongst the company of Intercessers which prov'd a pertic <br></br> lar blessingfor her own heart that she had the favour to have <br></br> an hour to speak with our in a Perticlar manner for her own and <br></br> his
         						Peoples cause, it was plain to be percevd amidst all her faults <br></br> and wants that her heart was truly connected with our
         							Sav<sup>r</sup><br></br> and atached to her choir, but the Sinner track being not always <br></br> clear to her interupted her in that tenderatachment to his Person <br></br> in beginning of <em>Oct<sup>br </sup>s</em> she took entirely
