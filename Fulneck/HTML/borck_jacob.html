            								1791</em></p>
      <p> Our late Bro. having left no written account <br></br> of his Life, we can only say the following: <br></br> He was born at <a href="#mlpla000210.html">Arendal in Norway</a><em>Oct. 13. 1727</em>. <br></br> He lost his Father when very Young, the pray- <br></br> ers &amp; admonitions of his Mother who was a <br></br> pious
         						Woman &amp; sought to Educate him in the <br></br> nurture &amp; admonition of the Lord were a great <br></br>
         							blessing to him, as a Child, &amp; when at <em>14 Years of <br></br> In age</em> he went to <a href="#mlpla000211.html">Copenhagen</a> &amp; there become Sur- <br></br> geons Mate in the Danish
         							Army, having been <br></br> brought up in that time of Life; In <em>1756</em> he enterd <br></br> Into the Service of the Russians army as Surgeon, <br></br> &amp; being in <a href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a>, he was noticed by several <br></br> persons of the highest Rank, both on Account <br></br> of his engaging manners &amp; Skilfulness in his <br></br>
         						profession, especially by the Viceroy of <a href="#mlpla000213.html">Ukraine</a><br></br> who greatly favord him, &amp; with whom he <br></br> travelled thro various parts of <a href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a>, but thro' <br></br> these
         						conexions he was led into bad Company, &amp; <br></br> sinful habits, by which means he lost those <br></br> impressions of our Savioursgrace, which he <br></br> had received in his Younger Years when he <br></br>had been solidly awakened, &amp; obtained a view <br></br> in Spirit of our Sav<sup>rs</sup> sufferings, which remain- <br></br> ed unforgetten by him. He however felt <br></br>great uneasiness of mind, amidst the gaieties <br></br> &amp; pleasures of the World, which he once disclosed </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> to a person of Rank in <a href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a> acquainted with <br></br> the B<sup>rn</sup> especially with <a href="#mlper000566.html">Count Zinzendorff</a>, who <br></br> spoke to him in and encourageng manner, &amp; <br></br> whose conversation was greatly blessed to him <br></br> the above mentioned person at the same time <br></br> related to him several particulars concerning <br></br> the
         							Cong<sup>n</sup> of the B<sup>rn</sup> which created a wish in him, <br></br> to become more nearly acquainted with them. <br></br> Accordingly in <em>1739</em> when he quitted <a href="#mlpla000212.html">Russia</a>, he <br></br> resolved to pay a visit to the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000150.html">Zeist</a>, intend- <br></br> ing to go from thence to <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, to enter into his <br></br>Majestys Service on board a Westindia Ship. The first <br></br>meeting he attended at <a href="#mlpla000150.html">Zeist</a> was a singing meeting <br></br> during which he was so overpowerd with a feeling of <br></br> divine Grace, that it was immediately made clear <br></br> to
         						him that this was the people he belonged to, having <br></br> always from his infancy had a desire to live among <br></br> Children of <a href=".html">God</a>:, Here he also got acquainted with <a href="#mlper000566.html">Count <br></br> Zinzendorff</a>, who
         						received him very cordially, Never- <br></br> theless he for the present, pursued his intentions <br></br> of proceeding to <a href="#mlpla000072.html">England</a>, where he engaged as Sur- <br></br> geon onboord the
         							Monarque in which Station he <br></br> remained about a Year, during the whole of which <br></br> time the Vessel lay in the harbours He
         						kept up in <br></br> the mean time an acquaintance with the B<sup>rn</sup> in <br></br><a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a>: But the great Wickedness &amp; abandoned <br></br> life of the Ships crews, to which he was witness was <br></br> so
         						disgusting to him, that he was glad to obtain <br></br> his dissmission. After this he lodged for a short time <br></br> with a B<sup>r</sup> &amp; S<sup>r</sup> in <a href="#mlpla000054.html">London</a> &amp; being desirous of coming <br></br> into still closer connection
         						with the Cong<sup>n</sup> of the B<sup>rn</sup></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> went in <em>Oct<sup>r.</sup> 1760</em> according to their advice to <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a><br></br> where he moved into the Single B<sup>rns</sup> House.</p>
      <p> Tho' he had it at first very hard in externals yet he <br></br> never despaired but was always thankful to our <br></br>Sav<sup>r</sup> for having brought him thither, &amp; used to express <br></br> himself to that effect, that he should esteem it the <br></br> greatest favor to live with Children of <a href=".html">God</a>, were he even <br></br> necessitated to
         						live on Bread &amp; Water. He first engaged <br></br> with the late <a href=".html">Doc. Vowel</a> as a partner in business, but <br></br> after sometime
         						this partnership was dissolved, &amp; <br></br>he set up for himself as Surgeon &amp;
         							Apothecary. </p>
      <p> He was received in the Cong<sup>n</sup> <em>April 20 1761</em> &amp; admitted <br></br> to the holy Comunion<em>Sept<sup>r</sup> 26 in the same Year</em>. </p>
      <p><em>Nov<sup>r</sup> 19<sup>th</sup> 1766</em>he was married to the <a href=".html">S. Sister Hanah <br></br>
            								Scorfield</a> of the Choir House at <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnec</a>, his present
         						<br></br> Widow by whom he has had one Daughter, now a <br></br> member of the Cong<sup>n</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000025.html">Bedford</a>, He was very success <br></br> full in his profession, whereby he also proved a bless- <br></br> ing
         						to many of his patients in their dying mom- <br></br> ents, was respected in the Town &amp; neighbourhood, <br></br> &amp; always a steady Friend to
         						the poor even to his own <br></br> disadvantage. Tho his warm &amp; positive temper<br></br> &amp; disposition sometimes caused him trouble, <br></br> Yet his upright Sincere &amp; generous mind pro- <br></br> cured him many Friends by
         						whom he was much <br></br> esteemed, The reflection on his past unfaithful- <br></br> ness to our SavioursGrace, &amp; the powerful sensa- <br></br> tions he had of his great depravity, caused him <br></br> indeed
         						many heavy hours, but amidst all this he <br></br> cleaved as a poor pardoned Sinner to his Redeemer</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> &amp; experienced rich comforts from him, which was <br></br> more especially perceptible in the last years of his <br></br> Life, when he grew
         						more chearful &amp; happy &amp; resigned<br></br> His constitution which was naturally strong, <br></br> had been much impaired by fatiague of body &amp; <br></br> mind, about 5 Years ago he got a paralitic Stroke<br></br> which greatly enfeabled him, Since this time he <br></br>suffered greatly from increasing weakness, which <br></br> at last brought on a total delay of strength. His <br></br> present
         						Widow our dear <a href=".html">Sister Borck</a>, has shew'n <br></br> great &amp; unremitting tenderness in faithfully nur- <br></br> sing him during this long period of illess. Amidst <br></br>his sufferings which was very great, his patience<br></br> was exemplary, &amp; he always expressed himself <br></br>thankful for the least services done him. </p>
      <p> When visited his favorite topick was the Love &amp; <br></br> forbearance of our Sav<sup>r</sup> so consisintly displayed <br></br> in the mercy shewn to him, being plucked as <br></br> a brand out of the fire. Several weeks before
         						<br></br> his departure it was evident, that he would not <br></br> continue long here below, from which time <br></br> forward, his mind seemed wholly disengaged<br></br> from all earthly cares, &amp; occupied in converse <br></br> with our Sav<sup>r</sup>, he frequently prayed fervently<br></br> to him, entreating our Sav<sup>r</sup> to strengthen him &amp; <br></br> support him in his trouble, &amp; especially to be <br></br> near him in his last hours, He once told a <br></br>Brother who visited him that altho he had the </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> full assurance that he should go to our Sav<sup>r</sup><br></br> as an absolved sinner, yet he could not deny <br></br> that he felt some dread at the thoughts of the <br></br> separation of Soul
         						&amp; Body, but some days <br></br> after he intimated to the same Brother, that <br></br> he could now say with
         							thanks to our Sav<sup>r</sup><br></br> that this dread had been entirely removed. <br></br> A day or two before his departure, he expressed <br></br> in a very emphatical
         						manner, his thankful <br></br> ness for having brought him to his ransom'd <br></br>Congregation &amp; sealed his Salvation. </p>
      <p><em>Oct<sup>r.</sup> 24<sup>th</sup> 1791</em> he was no longer able to speak, <br></br> &amp; from that time
         						lay Still in sweet expectati- <br></br> on of that blessed moment when his Redeemed <br></br> Soul should be translated into the mansions <br></br> of
         							bliss. This favor was granted him about <br></br> nine o Clock the same Evening when he <br></br> departed
         								softly &amp; happily aged 64 years 11 days</p>
      <p>Blessed are the dead, which die in the <br></br>Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, <br></br> that they may rest from their Labour, &amp; <br></br> their
         						works do follow them. Rev<sup>l</sup> 14. 13 </p>PAGE BREAK</body>
