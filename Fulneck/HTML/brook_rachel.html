      <h2>Rachel Brook</h2>
      <p> Our late Sr<a href="#mlper000223.html">Rachel Brook</a> was <br></br> born <em>Apr. 28<sup>th</sup>
            							1744</em> at <a href="#mlpla000030.html">Birstol</a>. <br></br> Her Parents, who loved the Lord<br></br> directed her from her earliest <br></br> years to the friend of Children <br></br> and took her, when a Child to the <br></br> Chaple at <a href="#mlpla000041.html">Gumersal</a>, where she at <br></br> tended the Childrens meetings, and <br></br> and used to be delighted to hear <br></br> of our
         							Saviourslove, and when <br></br> comming home she would some <br></br> time kneel down in a corner <br></br> and pray to him to bless
         						her <br></br> and form her to his mind. <br></br></p>
      <p><del>But</del> When she grew older she found <br></br> that tender Childlike love to our <br></br>Savr growing cold, she wished to injoy<br></br> the world, and its vain pleasures, <br></br> but always felt a monitor within, <br></br> warning her from going the broad <br></br> road, which
         						leadeth to destruction; <br></br> she spent some time in great <br></br><br></br></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>trouble of mind, not willing to <br></br> follow the Lord, and full
         							of fear<br></br> to be last eternally; during this <br></br> period, which was in her <em>16<sup>th</sup><br></br> year</em>, she had a very remarkable <br></br> dream: it was to her as if she <br></br> saw our Saviour on the Cross, in <br></br> the
         							most lovely attitude, saying <br></br> to her, "all my sufferings, wounds <br></br> and bruises were
         						for thee, to <br></br> save and redeem thy sinful soul." <br></br>This made a deep impression on her <br></br> mind, and she turned in earnest<br></br> prayer to the Lord, that he would <br></br> pardon her sins and transgressions <br></br> and renew a right spirit within
         						<br></br> her, &amp; once when walking in a field <br></br> by herself, with tears and prayer <br></br> lifting up her hands to him,
         							she <br></br> got an assurance that her guilt<br></br> should be done away, and that <br></br> he would prove her good Shepherd <br></br><br></br></p>
      <p> who seeks that which was lost <br></br> with unwearied faithfulness. <br></br> This has followed <sup>her</sup> all her life and <br></br> often thro' grace been renewed. <br></br></p>
      <p> She now felt a desire to be closer <br></br> united with the Brns Cong<sup>n</sup> and
         						<br></br> to injoy the priviliges of the same. <br></br><em>Oct 4<sup>th</sup> 1760</em>she moved into the <br></br> S<sup>rs</sup> House here in <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulnek</a>, <em>May 11. <br></br> 1761</em>she was recd into the B<sup>rns</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup><br></br>and <em>May 8<sup>th</sup> the following year</em><br></br>partook for the first time of <br></br> the H. Com<sup>n</sup>. She often spoke <br></br> with great pleasure, of the time <br></br> of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how happy<br></br> she was in communion with our <br></br>Saviour, and how comfortable the <br></br> S<sup>rs</sup> were together in the so called
         						<br></br> spinning days, and how they delighted<br></br> midst great poverty in singing the <br></br>praises of the Lord. She was <br></br> soon imployed in serving as an Over <br></br><br></br></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>seer with the Girls, and afterwards <br></br>with Sisters. In <em>1790</em>she was accepted <br></br> acoluth, and for <em>18 years</em> she held <br></br> the Office
         							of Houseservant, she <br></br> showed much faithfulness in what <br></br> was committed to her, and looked <br></br>upon it as a favour, which <br></br> made her Office a pleasant duty. <br></br><del>to her.</del> The last few years, she <br></br> was not able to do as formerly <br></br> but injoying the love of the
         							S<sup>rs</sup><br></br> they were willing to lend her a <br></br> helping hand whenever required, <br></br> particularly those S<sup>rs</sup> in her room <br></br> showed her much love &amp; attention. <br></br> Tho' nothing very striking seemed to <br></br> distinguish her course, we are sure <br></br> that she lived in communion with
         						<br></br> our Saviour, and with Childlike <br></br>confidence and humble faith looked <br></br> to him for help and support in <br></br> every time of need. <br></br><br></br></p>
      <p><em>Oct 4<sup>th</sup> 1810</em> she called to mind that <br></br> it was 50 years since she moved <br></br> into this house, she
         						expressed <br></br> herself that she could not suffi- <br></br> ciently thank our Saviour, for all <br></br> his love and care, his long suffering<br></br> and forbearance, and for all his <br></br>mercy towards her, and looked back <br></br> with gratitude and amazement how <br></br>
         						he had proved her true friends in <br></br> all her spiritual and temporal <br></br>concerns, that she had laked <br></br> nothing; and she renewed her <br></br> convenant to cleave to him, to <br></br>trust his Shepherd care, till <br></br>hope and faith shall cease, and <br></br>Love prevail alone. </p>
      <p> Hitherto she had injoyed an unin- <br></br> terrupted good state of health, but <br></br> now she began to feel the infir- <br></br> mities of age, and for these last 3 <br></br> years, she was not able to attend </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> the meetings as she used to do, <br></br> which was a great trial to her. </p>
      <p> She was however able to go about <br></br> in the house, tho' at last with <br></br> great difficulty, till the <em>6<sup>th</sup><br></br> of this month</em>, when she had to <br></br> be confined to the sickroom, her <br></br>weakness increased rapidly; tho' <br></br> she did not think that her de- <br></br> parture was so near, she felt <br></br>resigned to our Saviours will, <br></br> saying: "My times are in his hands <br></br> "I can <del>say</del> do
         						nothing but pray <br></br> "to him to receive me, a poor <br></br> "and worthless sinner, in mercy, <br></br> "and I am sure he will." - </p>
      <p> On the <em>13<sup>th</sup></em>Â she called to mind the <br></br>blessings she had often enjoyed on <br></br> that great memorial day, and <br></br> particularly what she had felt the
         						<br></br> first time, when she celebrated it <br></br> 55 years ago, during the singing of <br></br> that verse: <br></br></p>
      <p>O Church, how many hast thou yetWho do not love the Saviour?Who do not think his burden lightNor his sweet Yoke a favour!O ye, who don't stand well with him,Do ye long for redemption?Now, now, is for you the right timeCome all without exception.She spent the following days mostlyin a slumber, and when she awokebetween, <del>she</del> only complained on great weakness, she often foldedher hands, as being ingaged inprayers, when the lipps no morecould say; and on the 16<sup>th</sup> it pleased the Lord to call her to himself in a gentle and happymanner. Aged 71. 6 1/2 Month.Among the saints in light;Behold our Sister seated:Her faith now lost in sightHer happiness compleated: </p>PAGE BREAK
