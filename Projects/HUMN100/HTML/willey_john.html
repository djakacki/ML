      <p> 102. London Memoir Of Br
         John Willey, a Servant of the
         Lord in the Brn's Church, who departed
         this lifse in Gracehill, October
         6th 1847. Aged 66 years. Written by his children Not
         having been able to find any account of our dear father's
         life, written by himself, we can merely record some of the
         principal outward outward changes which he met with here,
         adding, the few remarks on himself and his experience, which
         have recurred to us in the private
         diaries of his congregation and in his
         cor(r)espondence. He was born Dec. 13th 1781 in
         Fulnec; his father,
         Michael Willey (born 1729
         died aged 86, having served the the Congregation 66 years" was
         at that time laborer of the Congregation at
         Pudsey. He had one sister being and
         one brother, Joseph, both older
         ​​​​​​​than 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 2 </h3>
      <p> than himself; of whom his brother was many years an active
         minister of several congregations, and was called home before
         him to his eternal rest, Aug. 11th 1841. A strong
         affection existed between the
         brothers, and some of our dear father's happiest seasons were the visits which he was
         occasionally though rarely able to pay to his brother and
         family. His early life, though chequered by the death of an affectionate mother, when
         he was only 6 years of age, appears to have passed very
         pleasantly among the youth in Fulnec.
         His old teacher B. Bradley, kept an
         unfailing place in his memory, and he spoke much and with
         great kindness of his well-remembered care and love. As a
         sign of the comparative innocences of those early years, he
         would mention the fact that he had never heard an oath
         ​​​​​​​until he had attained the age of 12 years 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 3 </h3>
      <p> years. From some narratives of that time which he would
         occasionally call to mind, it seems as tho' his habitual good temper had early displayed
         itself, and rendered him a favorite amongst his teachers and
         companions. At the age of 14, he went, as was there customary,
         to learn a trade in Bedford, where he
         experienced great kindness from Br.
         Livius, of whom he long retained a grateful
         recollection. Here of course, he was somewhat more of the
         world and of its ways of sinful pleasure, and appears to have
         lamented the want of Godliness
         amongst many of the young people with whom he was associated.
         It was particularly whilst on a visit in
         London, on his way to
         Kingswood that he was struck with
         the deep depravity of human nature, and found gratitude to that
         Lord, to whom he had been early led,
         and who had so mercifully held his preserving hand 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 4 </h3>
      <p> hand over him. At the same time, we doubt not, he obtained
         deeper views of his own sinfulness, and of his need of the
         salvation wrought for sinners, though the meritorious life and
         death of our Lord and SaviorJesus Christ. In 1802, when
         21 years of age, he went to Bristol;
         and on his father's being appointed laborer of
         Kingwood congregation about that
         time, he was frequently with him there assisting in the school
         in that place. It was here he was viewed with the
         Congregation, and shortly after, in 1804, very
         permitted to partake for the first time of the Holy Communion There events seem to
         have made a way deep impression upon his mind, if we may judge
         from a remarkable experience which he has recorded as having
         happened in him on the morning of Palm
         sunday1804. If it came upon me sleeping, he 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 5 </h3>
      <p> he writes, it made the same impression as though I had been
         awake. There came over me a great fear and trem- bling violent sweat, and a dread of being destroyed instantly. I
         lifted up my hand and raised my eyes, but could not rise, for
         the clothes were as a rock around me. There stood one whose
         eyes were fixed on me, with a shining light; before him an
         upright pillar, with which I expected to be slain, for the
         sense of my guilt increased my
         fear. I never can forget his
         look. He spoke - O how long have I delayed my coming; how long
         have I observed thy ways; I have had patience with thee; thou
         hast had advantages but thou hast neglected them; thy crimes
         are very great, thou hast been preserved through mercy hither to, but now ______ Here
         I prayed earnestly for mercy, that
         I might not Be destroyed in my sins; yet my heart was hard as
         the rock. I was powerfully convinced that it was
         Jesus who ​​​​​​​stood before me, and
         continued praying till 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 6 </h3>
      <p> Till at last he mercifully Caused floods of tears to flow
         from mine eyes. Where I still in treated him to have mercy on
         me a wretched and guilty sinner,
         his countenance changed, he seemed filled with compassion, looked on me with pity,
         and spoke to me kindly, so that I was convinced I was heard.
         His last words were very impressive. "Be in earnest for your
         soul's salvation lest I come quickly with a woe." Where he
         vanished, the pillar that that seemed ready to destroy me,
         appeared changed into a hom(e) of salvation. I awoke to my
         utter astonishment, and continued long in prayer for the
         assistance I have daily and hourly need from a crucified
         Savior. Our dear father appears about
         this time to have been tried with a delicate state of health, sometimes suffering from new and affections,
         which had their bad effects upon his spirits. In May
         1806 he went to Fulnec, and
         after midsummer the same year, he 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 7 </h3>
      <p> he entered as a teacher with Mirfield
         school. The next year he went to
         Fulnec, to take charge of the Day
         school there, but was soon again (Sept 1808)
         recalled to Mirfield. The 5 years spent
         in the school there, he remembered with much pleasure; he remembered great affection for his pupils, and not a
         few of his old schools have shown that theyt recall his memory
         with pleasure. He spoke after of
         his agreeable and brotherly intercourse with Br.
         Pohlman, there Minister and Director of the
         school at Mirfield. His spare time was
         spent in visiting the sick in the neighborhood, and in
         cultivating that science which always retained such attractions for him, and in which he
         certainly displayed mean talent. The corespondence afterwards
         maintained with his relative, Sir W.
         Hamilton on astronomical subjects, was a source
         of great delight to him; and the laborious and neatly expected
         tables and calculations which he has left behind him, show his
         
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 8</h3>
      <p>
         His ingenuity and talent. It was in
         Mirfield in March 1809, that he first
         publicly proclaimed the Gospel,to be-
         come a faithful minister of which, we
         sincerely believe, was his highest aim.
         In Sept. 1812he was called to be Sgle.
         Brn’s Laborer in Fulnec; a part which
         he found more difficult than the one
         he had occupied in Mirfield. He lament
         ed the wait(weight) of the spiritual life in ma-
         ny members of the choir for the good
         of which he was appointed to labor; and
         cases might occur here, as elsewhere,
         where his meek and yielding temper
         would make the exercise of proper disci-
         pline, and faithfulness in reproving, a
         difficult task for him.
         In June 1814 he was called to Dublin,
         As Sgle Brn’s Laborer, and remained in that  
         past for 3 years, during which time we
         know of little worth recording concerning
         him. In 1817 he was ordained in Grace-
         Hill by Br. Benade, and called to serve
         the Congn. at Ballinderry. August 21he
         was married to the Sgle .Sr.Susan Hutton,

         that teacher in the ladies school at 
         Gracehill. In Ballinderry they spent
         10 useful and happy years; but also
         their four oldest surviving children
         were born; one little daughter being
         taken from them by the Lord in early 
         infancy.   In 1826 they removed to
         Cootehill, a congregation which had been
         for some years without a Laborer, and 
         was in a very low condition, seeming
         to require all the energy which health
         and activity could supply. Here, as long
         as his health permitted him, our dear
         father labored cheerfully and in blessing.
         An account which he draw up for him-
         self of the various preaching places
         he attended in the neighborhood, and
         the success he met with in proclaim-
         ing the joyful news of saluation, tes-
         tifies to his activity. In the year 1833,
         1 year after his arrival in Cootehill,
         he visited 12 out-preaching places,
         mostly once a fortnight, at an average
         distance of 4 or 5 miles, and some
         12 and even 17 miles from Cootehill.

         The following memorandum at the
         close of 1832,will share the spirit in
         which he labored:”When at the close
         of this year, I take a view of my poor,
         imperfect services in the vineyard of 
         our Lord, I see much cause for the 
         deepest humiliation, on account of my
         innurmerable transgressions,failings,
         and short-comings, and fervently pray
         my merciful Saviour and gracious
         Lord and Master, to forgive me in all
         things  where in I have been to blame;
         whether it be in the omission of my
         duty, or in the performance of it in a
         wrong spirit, by hearkening at times
         to the secret whisper of approbation in 
         my unhallowed breast, and forgetting
         to give all the honor and glory to the Lord.
         It is by his gracious assistance, I 
         have been enabled to testify to my 
         fellow-sinners, the richness of his
         Grace; whereas, if he had left me
         to myself, I should have sunk into
         shame and confusion .O that self

         and pride might be so mortified in
         me, that I might even remember, that
         I am naught but a poor, worthless,
         unprofitable servant, and Christ
         my All!
         Lord keep me contrite, low and poor,
         Thus shall I praise thee memorie(his memory);
         Myself thrice blessed I can call,
         When I am nought, and thou my all!”
         In Cootehill,our dear Father’s
         health quickly declined, and symp-
         tons of those complicated diseases
         began to show themselves, which
         gradually affected almost every vi-
         tal part, and mostly disabled him
         from duty during the last six years
         of his life. Soon after his first serious
         attack, we find his experience recorded
         thus:”In the beginning of May 1841,
         I had a violent attack of influenza
         which lasted a long while, and caused
         me to notice to rest early in the after-
         noon. In the month of July I left
         Cootehill for Ballinderry in hopes
         that the change of air might be of

         service to me ; but this not being the
         case, I begged my dismissal from ac-
         tive Service in Cootehill, for I saw my- 
         self necessitated to notice from the work
         and labor of love in which my soul
         delighted, by the severe Affliction by
         with which a merciful and long-suf-
         ferring Saviour visited me. I humbly,
         bow down with submission to his bles-
         sed will, and can say in this trial.
         As I was enabled to do when lately
         receiving the account of my dear Bro-
         ther's departure: “It is the lord, let him
         Do what seemeth him good.” I feel too
         weak to participate deeply of the cup
         of affiliation, and my dear Saviour
         favors me, by permitting me to leave
         all my griefs with him, and he con-
         fonts me in such a manner that I can
         not say I have had an hours real dis-
         tress. After nearly 15 years labor amongst
         the little flock at Cootehill,  having long
         shared both joy and grief with them,
         It is no wonder that I feel much at
         the thoughts of being obliged to resign
         
      </p>

         my change of them. My prayers at least
         on their behalf, shall be continued at
         the throne of grace. In looking at the fu-
         ture, it is still my desire, that if our
         Dear Lord and Master should be pleased
         to bless the means used for my recovery,
         I may yet be employed in some part or
         other of his vineyard, to bear still further
         testimony of his great love to sinners. O
         might I be more devoted to Him and
         serve Him more faithfully till the end
         of my days.”
         In the course of some months, our father
         thought himself sufficiently recovered
         to assume his labors in Cootehill, and
         accordingly removed thither from Bal-
         linderry in March 1843. The Brn. &amp; Srs.
         rejoiced exceedingly on his return, wel-
         coming him with the sincerest to-
         kens of affection; and the ensuing pas-
         sion season proved a time of great en-
         joyment to this little flock and to their
         pastor. But in the autumn of the same
         year he felt his strength again failing,
         and in the winter he was frequently 
         
      </p>

      <p>    
         unable to preach.
         In the summer of 1844, he felt in(it) ne-
         cessary again to leave Cootehill, to which
         he never returned, but took up his resi-
         dence with his children at Glenary,
         till the following year 1845. In April
         he returned to Gracehill, with the expecta-
         tion of ending his days in the midst
         of that Congregation.  In the summer of
         1846, according to the Doctor’s advice, he
         sought change of air, and spent upwards
         of 4 months and lodgings near Bally-
         Castle, close to the sea-shore, which he
         believed through the Lord’s blessing,
         helped to prolong his life.
         In the beginning of October he re-
         turned to Gracehill, and in the follow-
         ing winter endured much pain and
         severe suffering, with patience and
         resignation. To his Saviour’s will,
         which his faith and love taught
         him to regard as always conducive
         to his own real good. The vacations
         at midsummer and Christmas,
         when he could collect his children

         around him were during these three
         years of trial, seasons of great plea-
         sure to him, and we have at such
         times been frequently struck with his
         cheerfulness and time enjoyment of
         life amidst all its drawbacks, and
         edified with the example of resigna-
         tion and Christian patience which he
         presented to us. He did not converse
         much on subjects of spiritual experi-
         ence, but his own interest in the
         truths of revelation, and particularly
         his love for and delight in our hymns
         was always apparent.
         When the spring of 1847 returned with-
         out any lasting improvement in his
         state, he could express himself as per-
         fectly resigned to the Lord’s will with
         him, though he naturally longed for
         ease and outward comfort, and faith-
         fully used every means recommend-
         ed. His faith meanwhile seemed
         purified in the fire of these afflic-
         tions, and his love and gratitude
         to the Saviour, were more ardent

      <p> than Perhaps at every former period of his life. we find the
         following reflections written in the
         summer of this year: It had been my lot to be afflicted for
         the last five years of my life, but I had abundant cause to
         bless the Lord for his meeting me in the
         way he has done, since nothing else would have brot me so
         closely to his feet. I have learnt more of the love of Jesus,
         in the school of affliction, than I ever
         knew before, and I can rejoice in Christ
         Jesus as my faithful helper in time of need, my
         good physician and
         nurse, and my merciful
         savior who for forgiveth all my iniquities. I have no confidence in
         any other; in him alone I place my trust, and find him always
         willing to help me. I delight to
         look to him by faith, and to think that though he is in the
         brightness of his glory, he permits me a poor sinful creature
         to behold him in His 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 18 </h3>
      <p> his suffering, in his deep humiliation in the
         garden, died on the cross. He
         knows that nothing else can comfort
         me in the midst of my pain, and
         thus he structures my cup and makes
         me resigned and cheerful. I have passed through years
         of trial and suffering, I have come
         through great tribulation, yet I do not wish it had been less;
         I am sure my Savior has proportioned this
         chastisement to the necessities I neglected to bring me wholly
         to himself, that I might see the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
         be completely weaned from this present evil world, and live
         solely to his praise and glory. Blessed be his name, he has in
         a great measure affected his gracious purpose, and my joy no man can take from me." In
         another place he says: "The blessings I have enjoyed, especially during the latter
         part of my sufferings, have been so
         rich and great, that I have most sincerely thanked our
         precious Savior Jesus, for visiting Me
         
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 19 </h3>
      <p> me with this very affliction, since it has opened to me more
         clearly the pathway to glory." After making an affecting
         comparison between his own distress, and the far greater and meritorious sufferings of his
         Saviour, he adds: "I know he loves me and I love him sincerely, but not as I ought. I can never
         love him here as I ought for
         what he has done for me." The change of
         residence to the shore of the
         lake which was made at his request in
         May, seemed at first to revive him, but it became gradually more and more
         evident, that it was not the Lord's will
         to lengthen his life here, but to take him soon from tribulation here below, to the pleasures for even more at his right
         hand. About the middle of Sept. he returned to his resting place in
         Grace- hill, there in patience to await the
         Lord's good time to call him In the
         visits which the laborers of the
         Congregation paid him in these last
         weeks, He

      <p> he appeared to continue in the sacred resigned and happy frame. His humiliation deepened till the last, his views of
         faith were cleaner, his love grew
         stronger. He mentioned the ways which he used to sing _ And
         there may I as vile as he, Wash all my sins away, but which he
         now called joyfully repeat _ And
         there have I as vile as he, washed all my sins away. He said
         he believed if he had seen this Gospel doctrine so clearly at
         the time of his early ministry as he did now, his preaching
         would, with the Lord's blessing, have
         been more effectual. His extreme weakness had after led himself and others to think
         the time of his departure mean at hand, and as often he had
         again, regained his strength, battling the skill of the
         physicians. On the night of Oct.
         5 he was home to rest as
         usual, and though exceedingly weak,
         he was in a peaceful, happy state of mind, full of heavenly contemplation, his thought
         evidently resting.

      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 21 </h3>
      <p> resting on some object which filled him with a calm and holy joy. Whilst being settled for the night, he
         repeatedly said: "How much! how much to sleep in
         Jesus!" One of his children asking
         him, whether he meant the sheep or the body, he only answered
         with a placid smile. He'd had, no
         doubt, a presentiment that he was about to fall in to that
         sleep in Jesus, which with his believing
         people only the spiritual awakening to endless happiness in his presence _ His last
         words were: "How much to be a sheep of
         Jesus." After this, he slumbered
         quietly til towards morning, where a change apparently coming
         over him, his wife and the three of his
         children there with him, assembled around his bed to witness
         his gentle and happydeparture from this world of suffering, to that happier one of endless felicity and glory. They sung a verse with breaking voices, of
         which he appeared just conscious
         and soon after he gently slept away,
         resigning

      <p> signing his spirit without a struggle with the faithful hands of
         Jesus, of that
         Lord whom he believed in and loved, and in whose presence, we
         doubt not, he now enjoys the happiness and rest reserved for those
         whose sins are washed away in his blood, and whose spirits are
         clothed in the garment of his mighteaness We only add as his
         bereaved family, that whilst we sorrow at the loss of one beloved by all who knew him, and doubly endeared to
         us, we sorrow not as those that
         have no hope; may rather, so confident are we of his present happier state, so glad to think of
         his release from so much suffering,
         that we rejoice, and join him in praising the
         Lord for his past mercies to his
         servant, and for the communication of
         that happiness which he is now
         enjoying. May the example of
         our father's faith, together with the solemn experience of the
         days that we his secure children have
         spent together on this last mournful

      <p>mournful occasion, be impressed
         deeply upon our hearts, and through our
         Lord's grace be for a blessing on each

         rejoining our beloved father
         before the throne of God and of the Lamb,
         support his widow and our dear
         mother, through the remaining years of
         her earthly pilgrimage, that we may all join as the
         Lord's redeemed, with the great family
         of God above. Amen!
