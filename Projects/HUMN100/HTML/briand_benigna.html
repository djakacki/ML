         Here followed the 22nd of March our
         dear Sister Benigna Briand.
         She was born the 17th of December 1707 at Lyneham in 
         Wiltshire. Her Parents have been of the Quaker Religion
         &amp; She was brought up in the same Principles.
         Anno 1740 the 19th february was She marryed to our Br.
         Briand &amp; they followed a religious Life according to 
         her Principles, But as Br. Cennick in this county his
         Preachings begun, She &amp; her Husband went to hear him
         but Both got such an Impression at first that they offered
         Br. Cennick their house for for a Preaching Place, that was
         not all but they offered every Body who came to hear him
         to harbour free. They bought at last a House &amp; provided
         a Silence to preach therein.This oeconomie (economy) continued 
         many years, without finding hereby any Rest for their
         own Heart. Br. Cennick was perfected all round the 
         Country, &amp; by that means our Sister often herself
         in Danger of her Life. To the same Time it happened 
         that a certain Man was so enraged about Br. Cennicks
         Preachings from the Blood of Christ, that he made a
         Plot with several wicked People that they would, Br. Cennick as his 
         Auditory guide overstream with Blood of Oxen.
         But this Man on a Sudden became mad &amp; clear Blood
         ran out of his nose &amp; Mouth &amp; this continued several 
         weeks under extraordinary Pain, his terrible &amp; furious 
         Sooth made, that nobody would venture to come near 
         him,
         ///
         till he at last with Howling &amp; bawling went to Eternity.
         All his Companions found in some Way or other by &amp; by a
         comendable End. In this restless Time, Br. Briand 
         accompanyed Br. Cennick to London &amp; there lernt (learned) by 
         that Opportunity to know the Brethren he was so over-
         taken by the Grace of Christ among them, that he on 
         his Retour testifyed it to his dear Wife to a great Im-
         pression of her Heart. She directly begg'd him that he
         would invite the Brethren to Wiltshire, which done 
         according to the general Desire of the awakened Souls 
         in this Parts. Br. Schlicht was the first after Br. Cennick
         who was sent thiter (thither), his Testamony of Christ found Applause 
         &amp; our Sister declared herself: for this Preachings of the 
         Sake of our Saviour I venture my All. Now begun  
         her Period wherein our Saviour begun to draw nearer 
         to her Heart, her natural Fire begun by Degrees to 
         dye &amp; the holy Ghost brought her in his School to a 
         more childlike &amp; yielding Temper. As our Mr. Johanes 1748 the 9 of May in Buttermere the Congregation 
         errected she was baptiseth by him in the Death of 
          Christ by the Name Benigna &amp; that was her Name 
         by right &amp; the 22nd of September a.c. She was admitted to 
         the holy Sacrament to a real &amp; remaining Blessing for her Heart.
         She lived 7 Miles distant of us, but surely came every
         Sunday to our Preaching &amp; that 6 years, till she removed
         with her Husband to Bath. Here she entertained the Brethren 
         as formerly which just now begun to visit and preach
         in

         in this Parts, with all imaginable Tenderness &amp; wish'd
         nothing more as that the Brethren would settle in this 
         Place. In the meantime She &amp; her Husband visited diligently
         at Bristol till 1757. a Society was errected at Bath.
         Her House was the Residence of our Labourer &amp; She
         made it her Pleasure to serve them. Our Saviour 
         blessed her marriage with 6 children, whereof 4 is 
         ready by our Lord &amp; the rest is in the Care of the 
         Congregation. Our blessed Sister had extra ordinary
         Gifts of our Saviour. Her skillfull &amp; understanding 
         Behaviour, &amp; the Maintainance of so many, of her poor 
         Nighbours, which She with a willing Heart took upon
         her, caused that every Body loved &amp; respected her.
         Her Heart hung on our Saviours, &amp; his Death &amp; Suffering,
         was the most delightfull object of her Soul.
         By the last visit of Br. &amp; Sister Nitshman on this Place
         She came among the Hourly Intercessors, which was
         a real Blessing to her &amp; She came never from her 
         Conversation Hour with our Saviour without Tears
         in her Eyes. I was with Plesure to behold how She 
         from Day so became more tender &amp; intimate with her  
         only Friend &amp; bloody Bridegroom of her Soul! Scarcely 
         could a Body him name to her, then her Tears of
         Love begun to flow. As She in June was in Bristol
         She said: "Now I come not more hither, till I am to
         be buryed here." the 13th She enjoyd our Lords Supper
         the last time, &amp; not long after She was forced to lay down
         &amp; as 
         ///
         it could be guessd; that She would get the Smal Pox.
         One of her Daughters did all She could to hinder that her 
         Dear Mother should not be perplext about it; to which 
         She said: "My dear Child, why should I be afraid thereof,
         Our Saviour must take one day or another to promote my
         Departing from this dying Body, if it is by this Way
         his holy Will, that's all one to me." May he only give
         me Patience, then my most happy Lot is to be with
         him. the 16th of March, the Smal-Pox became visible,
         She defyneth her Husband to absent himelf because
         he had not to, &amp; declard to him that she was quite
         resignd into the will of our Saviour. The following 
         Day came her Daughter from Bristol to see her, to 
         which she related the blessed Situation she was in.
          The 21st as Mr. Miller asked her: if She intented
         to go home. She replied: yes, that I will, if it is 
         the Pleasure of my Saviour to fetch me. There is no
         Misunderstanding between me &amp; him. Her Pain
         She endured with astonishing Patience &amp; said:
         What's that little Skinmark in Proportion to what our 
         Saviour endured for my Sake. The Night following
         a great Alteration happened by her. Her Daughter
         inquired: Mummy will you really go home? "Yes replied 
         She." but I must first see some Br. &amp; Sisters."
         She then went for Br. &amp; Sr. Miller but as they came
         she found her speachless all ready. They kept her a 
         pretty Liturge &amp; under these Words: Der konig 
         wende sich zu dir, und deine narbe riech &amp; flew
         her

         her happy Soul into the Bosom of her bloody Bride 
         groom. In the 56th Year of her Age Her Husband 
         who had in his Sleep an Instinct of her
         Departure, said as he awaked to the People in the House:
         My Wife is gone, fell down on his Face &amp; thanked our 
         dear Saviour for all the Blessings bestowed on her. Soon
         after that, Mr. Miller came before his Door &amp; sung: Ihr
         Mund ist mnn erblasset in Jesu Arm u. Schooss, as
         the 25th was her Corps upon her Desire brought to 
         Bristol &amp; there intered.
         the 25th Br. Rogers did the Act of his Function as 
         Mr. Chapmann's Vicar performed the Prayer of the
         english Church in the Church at Bath &amp; preach'd the 
         Days following in his Country Chaples.
