      <p> Page 1: -Vo.10. G. Gd Life I. Holmes of the widow Sr. Elizabeth
         Grundy, late Alvid, who departed this life
         at Nayldon in Yorkshire, May
         the 9th 1799. She has dictated the following account of her life to her
         son, our Br. James Grundy: I was
         born February 6. 1717. near Chowbent in the parish
         of Leigh in Lancashire, and brought up in the
         Presbyterian persuasion. My parents were very pious, and
         educated their children with great strictness. I was the youngest of their
         daughters. Whenever I did any thing amiss, my mother used to preach the Law to me,
         which made me look upon God as an angry Being. In my 8th year that I had the following dream: I dreamed
         it was the day of judgment, and I saw an innumerable
         multitude around me. I wished to see our Savior but was afraid of being seen by him; however, as I thought, I
         moved forward, and thrust myself between two persons to have a right of him. This
         I had no sooner done than he turned to me, as he was sitting at a table, and smiled. Hereby I was to much encouraged, that I went strait up to him, and now I saw two books lying
         before 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 2</h3>
      <p> him. One of them he opened, which I took to be the book of life, as it appeared
         written with blood. Upon this I awoke, but the dream left an impression upon my
         mind, that our Savior was very loving however, I left it again by having the law preached to me. Thus
         I spent my years of childhood like most others. I wanted to be good, but could
         not. Still I depended much on being born of religious parents, as being the seed
         of the righteous, upon which the Presbyterians of that day laid
         great stress. My father dying in my 12th year, my mother
         was left to care for our education, and to provide for our maintenance. The latter
         she did by keeping a school, and the former she performed in the strictest manner,
         and she sometimes corrected us very sharply, as she took
         Solomonâ€™s words for her rank: "He that spareth the rod,
         hateth his son '_' Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he
         will not depart from it." Before my fathers death I had a
         fever, which, with occasional intermissions, lasted 18 weeks, but I
         always thought I should recover. When I was 14 years old I went
         to nurse a child of a relation; and going on to see my mother our
         Savior drew me in to my heart on the road: 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 3</h3>
      <p> and in my prayer I addressed him as the God of
         Abraham, Isaac and
         Jacob. It came into my mind to make a
         covenant with him, and then being some stones in the place, I took them
         for a witness of it. But I soon broke this covenant, for
         getting into company I lived like others, yet my conscience always condemned me.
         Thus I formed good resolutions and as often brake them again; still the
         Lord pursued me with infinite patience. In my 22nd year
         I commenced school keeping under the inspection of
         the Revd. Mr. Valentine, a Presbyterian
         Minister. He being an Arian, tho not of the worst soul, I imbibed some of his
         principles. I argued with my mother about Predestination, and their great show of
         religion; and told her, among the rest, that thou who held that doctrine were
         hypocrites. This made her examine herself, as she told me of on her deathbed,
         thanking me for it and declaring that she had found my observation true with
         regard to herself. During her last illness she felt great condemnation, all her
         sins appearing to her view, which made her turn to our Savior
         and cry out: "Dear Savior, where is thy precious blood, that
         blood which thou did/ 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 4</h3>
      <p> shed to cleanse me from my sins?" Scarce had she uttered this ejaculation, when
         our Savior appeared to the eye of her faith, in his bleeding
         attitude, which the soldier opened his side with the spear, and she felt as it
         were his blood trickling upon her heart. Now she was enabled to rejoin in
         God our Savior. Shortly before her
         end she said: "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly," and then fell
         asleep in Jesus with a lovely smile upon her countenance. Her
         happily departure made so deep an impression upon me that I could never forget it,
         at the same time begetting a strong desire within me, to profess real religion;
         but to this the vanities of the world proved a great hindrance. Nevertheless, my
         mind was strongly convicted of my folly; one night in particular, which at a
         dance, I was so terrified, that I was obliged to withdraw, being struck with the
         reflection, what would become of me, if I should be cut off in that state. Another
         time I was so alarmed at my situation that I went to the above mentioned minister
         after midnight and called him up; but he told me that I had nothing to fear, as I
         had always been a good woman, and that God was merciful and
         would not mark iniquity so strictly. 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 5</h3>
      <p> Thus I was rightly served for having applied to him instead of our
         Savior. I expected he would have put me in the way of
         doing something whereby to merit heaven; but instead of this, he addressed me to
         put it off by going into cheerful company, lest I should grow melancholy. I
         foolishly took his advice, endeavoring to shake off conviction as much as
         possible. In this way I proceeded till I was married, and even after that, for a
         while, followed the fashions of the world. But, my husband, being a religious
         member of the church of England, protested against that mode of living. His
         Minister being an unawakened man and performing divine service only in the
         morning, we went in the afternoon to a Baptist chapel. Under a sermon in that
         place on the words: "Almost thou persuadest me to be a
         Christian," we were both so affected that we wept, which the
         Minister showed, how far a person may go, and yet be only almost a christian. We
         continued to hear him till the birth of my first child, when he wanted to persuade
         us not to have it baptized, to which my husband would by no means agree. My
         husband read frequently in the New Testament and when he loved the book, used to
         say : "I 
      </p>Page 6 
      <p>
         thank God for Paul's Epistles; best this of
         my taste at that to live, for I would rather
         read of Goliath, Lampoon, Joseph, he's brethren
         on of battles; however he continued reading
         Paul's Epistles, without minding one.
         My husband being an officer is the exercise
         his duty was frequently too hard for, so
         that he was often ailing. In January 1749.
         he ever taken seriously ill, and sent, that
         he should like to deposit, adding, thou am
         happy, who can soon leave the world in
         peace.  I complained that he had lost
         his regard for me, but he assured me,
         that his love for me was not decreased;
         but he saw nothing in this world worth existing
         to stay in it for. I then asked him,
         'whether he was first to leave?' He replied,
         "All my fitness is what Jesus Christ did for
         me on the cross." This I did not then understand. In that state of heart he departed,
         which was accompanied with such a happy
         feeling, as filled me with astonishment.
         His death took place Feb. 22, 1748. In the
         29th year of his age.
         After his Departure, their words: "I will be
         a husband to the widow, and a father to the fatherly", were interpreted upon my mind; you
         
      </p>
      <p> shed to cleanse me from my sins?" Scarce had she uttered this ejaculation, when
         our Savior appeared to the eye of her faith, in his bleeding
         attitude, which the soldier opened his side with the spear, and she felt as it
         were his blood trickling upon her heart. Now she was enabled to rejoin in

      <p>
         I was full of disbelief and not say, "Thy
         will be done." Then I was left without house
         or home, having one child, called William, and
         far advanced in pregnancy with another. I
         soon set off for my native plan, which was
         200 miles different, and travelled on foot nine
         days, in frost and snow. On the arrival at
         the home of one of my sisters, my husband's
         father sent for me and took me into his
         family.  Here I was in about three weeks
         brought to bed of my son, James, with whom
         I now live, and who is a member of the brother
         church and one of their preachers.
         After the birth of my son, confidently that
         he had now no father to care for him, it was
         as tho' our savior stood at my bed side and com
         forted me. I laid my hand on the childs'
         head and devoted him to the Loved and his service and to the entirety his. This ever accompanied with the deepest sensation I had ever
         had of the presence of Jesus, and yet it was
         as if he said to me, "Thou does not know me
         yet." Indeed I did not know him, even by the
         name of Jesus, but only as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and when I did a
         gain and again, I found no comfort; but
         
      </p>

      <p>
         at last, it was impressed on end to call
         when Jesus, which I did, saying, "Lord Jesus
         have mercy upon me!" No sooner had I cal
         led upon him by that name, them my condemnation was all taken away, and I rejoiced
         wondering at there at the same time, that I had read
         my Bible so often, and had never called upon Jesus before. Now then words came
         into my mind, "He shall be called Jesus, for
         he shall save his people from their sins, and
         I rejoiced in God my Savior.  This impression
         was so deeply fixed in my heart, that when 
         relieving to rest, I always looked to him in
         spirit on hanging of, on the cross.
         For sometime after, I had been concerned
         for my salvation, and now I felt delirious
         to be connected with a people of God. In
         this view I went to bear the Methodists, looking upon them as a people of God.  I read
          Mr. Whitfield's Sermon and saved several
         of Mr. Wesley's preachers. I joined the Methodists, and with great Zeal frequented their
         meetings tho I had sometimes to walk
         four miles in the dark. But by and bye,
         observing how they differed among themselves
         about points of doctrine, I left them,
         thinking they were not a people of God
         
      </p>

      <p>
         because they were not of one heart and mind.
         About this time I heard of the Brethren,
         getting my first impressions of them by
         means of their hymn book of which I was very fond, especially of that hymn:
         "O tell me no more of this world's vain story;
         The time for such trifles with me now is o'er.
         I wished much to know, where to find thou
         people, who had published their hymns. At
         lengths I learned that they had a chapel in
         Durkenfield, and that they were expected
         soon to preach at a home in Thackerley, a
         mile distant from where I live. I waited
with impatience for the day of the preach-
ing.Â  I went thither and heard Br. Greening
with the greatest pleasure and satisfactionÂ Â 
and spent the whole day in his company.
         Indeed I perceived him in another Apostle
         Paul.  I immediately thought, "this people
         shall be my people, their God my God, with
         them. I will live and die and be buried"; and
         of this resolution I never repented. This
         was fulfilled what my dear late mother
         said to me, shortly before her departure
         for calling me alone to her bedside she said:
         "I have waited with our savior, and was

         assured that thou shall be his and belong to the
         people of God, but what people and where and
         when I cannot tell; but it will not be yet;
         After this Mr. Valentine, the above mentioned
         Arian Minister, told me, I had changed for the
         worse by joining the Brethren. I sent him the
         nine discourses on Christ's Divinity, by Count
         Zinzendorf; but they did not please him. Soon
         after he fell sick; I felt great concern for
         him and went often to converse with him.
         whenever I mentioned anything about the
         discourses I sent him, he was out of patience
         and desired me to visit him no more; nevertheless, I told him, that I was concerned for him
         and should call again to see him.  However
         stayed away for sometime, but hearing that
         he grew very weak, I resolved to visit him again, as I felt very anxious about his happiness. Coming to his home I was informed by
         his daughter, that he ordered her to suffer
         none to come to him, not even his own children.  I therefore sent my love to him, which
         was ongoing after his health.  This being delivered, he desired his daughter to send me to him,
         as he wished to see me.  When I came to his
         bed side, he put out his hands to me, and appeared like an affectionate, loving child, and
         said "We have had many arguments, but
         
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 11

      <p>
         now I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior." I replied. "He is a Savior to them that believe." To
         this he replied: "I do believe, and I have no merit of my own; but trust alone in my Savior's death and merits. There is something to
         go through in death, but the prophet beyond it
         is bright; but I cannot say much, I was very
         weak. "We then took a tender leave of each other,
         and soon after he departed in peace.
         My oldest son, William, died the same year,
         after a long illness.  Shortly before his departure,
         being very sensible of his approaching dissolution,
         he called on to his bed, expected his desire to
         go to Jesus, bade each other farewell, and looked his
         eyes and fell happily asleep in the Lord, in
         the 7th year of his age.
         In 1755 a congregation of the Brother was settled at
         Duckenfield, at which solemnity I was profound
         and my heart was offered like that of Lydia.
         From that time connection with the church of
         the Brethren became very weighty to me and has remained so ever since, one which account I was
         the more greived at not being received a member of them; this favour was, however,
         granted me the year following.
         At Thackeray, I opened a little shop for my maintenance and had a good prospect of doing well;
         but feeling my heart in danger of being drawn
         
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 12

      <p> away by worldly prosperity, and being afraid of
         losing by any means that happiness, which was then and
         has been ever since of the last importance to me, I gave my shopkeeping in the
         midst of prosperity, and these words of our savior followed
         me continually, "What shall it profit a man, tho' he gains the whole world and loves his own soul."
         And I think it would be well for many, even members of the Brethren
         church, if this was duly considered. I can say with truth, that
         from that day to this, our savior, and fellowship with his
         people have been more important to me than anything else in the world. 
      </p>
      <p> In August 1756. I moved to
         Duckenfield, as a member of that congregation. Here I
         found it very difficult to come through. I had not only to go twenty miles for the
         work, by which I earned a livelihood, but the necessities of life, particularly
         bread ran to double the price, they had been sold
         for a fifth before. Yet I never repented of having moved hither, but was content and happy with a
         small portion of very mean, fare; and my son, who was now nine years old, was the
         same. Our savior abundantly blessed us internally, and we
         spent our time, while at work, with singing of Him and his sufferings, being
         enabled to take our refuge to him in all our circumstances. 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 13
         
      </h3>
      <p> When things were at the worst we would sing: "As small birds are a hole to cheer In hollow trees
         for cover, When whirlwinds blow when hail and snow O'er man and beast do hover: So I to then,
         Lord Christ, do flee, Within thy wounds retired; When sin
         and death did stop my breath, Here I again reposed." This time was indeed a
         blessed period. In January 1758. I had the favour to partake of the H.C. for the first time in the
         Brethren church. I felt so unworthy of it, that I hardly durst venture; "Heav'nly joy and holy trembling I felt in me past dissembling." This
         divine repast proved a great blessing to me. Hitherto I had been in a certain
         rapturous way, which in some measure was there more looked for, them a sinners'
         believing reliance on the all sufficient merit and atonement of
         Christ. I had made a fine covenant with our
         savior to be his in all circumstances, both adverse and
         prosperous, not questioning but I could stand any trial, for I fear, that he had possession of my heart, and I had an assurance that he would
         safely lead me. Not withstand

      </h3>
      <p> ding this I had soon after a severe trial, which was augmented by my want of self
         knowledge. Falling sick and feeling myself very poor, and full of unbelief, I
         began to question the love of our Savior, thinking, if the
         Lord be with me, why am I thus? Hitherto I had imagined
         that believers had a fund of support within themselves, so that I thought, it was
         inconsistent with a child of God to have any doubts and fears. Thus I was so
         confounded as to be almost driven to despair, and because like a shipwrecked
         mariner, thrown at once from the pleasing prosperity the promised land upon a
         desolate rock, where nothing appeared but horror &amp; devastation. The gloom, which had thus overspread me, continued a good
         while, and tho' I had frequent visits from our Savior, still
         I could not regain my cheerfulness, for I had not yet
         learned to cleave daily by faith as a needy sinner to Jesus.
         Indeed this point was not then so well moderated by some of us, as it has been
         since; After it was expected that a child of God should be
         cheerful and happy
         without any interruption, and this idea afforded me sufficient cause for self
         condemnation. But since then I have learned to know more of the privilege,  by a believer, of turning with all his selfishness, to our
         Savior and finding

      <p> in him a present help in time of need, which is an inexhaustible fund, where we
         may take grace for grace, and not look for it in any of our own attainments. Some
         time after I was appointed to begin a school for girls
         in Duckenfield, which gave me great confidence in our Savior, considering it as an
         answer to my prayer; for I was at times so full of unbelief, that I thought myself
         beneath his notice. I opened this school with eleven
         girls, children of some of the Brethren church, and continued
         it fifteen years. This was a happy period both for me
         and the children, several of the latter afterwards became members of the
         Congregation and likewise some of their parents. At length,
         not being able to procure a proper place for my school,
         and having to give up the hours I had hitherto occupied, I was, to my great grief, obliged to drop it. In consequence of various
         disagreeable occurrences, it appeared as if the time for my continuing the school was over. About this time my son, whom from his
         birth I had entirely devoted to our Savior, moved into the Brethren house in
         Duckenfield,

      <p> in the year 1760, and in 1766. He
         went to Fulneck, This last removal went very near
         me, but I durst not stand in our Savior's way, believing it
         would be for the best. Having lodged for sometime with a private family [at some
         distance] from Duckenfield, who behaved very well to me, I
         began to grow tired of having so far to go to the meeting. I therefore, sought
         leave to live in Fulneck, which I obtained. I went thither
         in 1778, and lodged as a visitor in the widow's
         house. Here I had to learn a new business, for the sake of earning a
         livelihood, which made it heavy to me in the beginning, and I was at times unhappy in my mind. But the chief reason of all my distress was, that I did not in every circumstance turn
         as a poor sinner to our Savior; He, However, at length,
         enabled me, confidently to come to him, as my unchangeable friend, who had
         always approved himself to me as my merciful Believer and
         Savior. I was much assisted at this time by the advice
         given me by a certain Brother, who with the tenderness of a
         father encouraged me, assuring me that I would gradually regain my wounded cheerfulness; and this I found verified. But what gave me
         comfort above all other things, in my greatest

      <p> trials, was the imperfection that my Savior had died for me,
         and this, I trust will remain so unto the end. I say indeed from my inmost soul: "His death and passion ever, Till soul and body sever, Shall in
         my heart engraved remain." This has been indelibly
         impressed upon my mind, ever since he first manifested
         himself to my soul as my Redeemer. In May 1780.
         my son received a call to begin a school and care for
         the Brethren Society in Bayldon. In
         consequence of this he married. My daughter in law
         growing consumption after her first delivery, moved for
         her health to her parents in Huddersfield, where she departed this life, and the child soon followed
         her into eternity. I therefore went to live with my
         son in October 1787. and began a school
         for girls; and in this situation I have remained till now, when I live
         in daily expectation to be dismissed from all labour and sorrow, eternally to rest and rejoice in the presence of my
         God &amp; Savior. In this place a new
         period in my life commenced, and I learned to know, more than ever, that I must
         lean on my Savior, and him only. It was clear to me that I
         had a call to Bayldon, and that I was in my proper place
         when teaching school; our Savior
         who often visited

      <p> me and blessed my endeavors. I became more stripped of my self righteousness, and
         learned to rely more fully on the merit and faithfulness of
         Jesus, in all circumstances for which I can never thank
         him sufficiently. Nevertheless I now and then got into a way of self, which
         caused me no small anxiety: but my all merciful Savior has
         helped me and been very gracious to me, amid it all my
         infirmities of soul and body. I have often been troubled with needless
         perplexities when reflecting on old age, and how I should get a maintenance in
         that case; for I was always afraid of being
         burdensome; which I have never been to anyone, not even when I had two children to
         support by my own hand-labour. But in this respect also the Lord has been better
         than my fears and put me to shame, by prospering my endeavors, so that I have more
         abundance now in my 83rd year, than I have has at any time, since I became a
         widow, which is 51 years: and I cannot but acknowledge it as a singular favor,
         that I am able, tho' in much weakness, to teach children as well as ever in any
         part of my life; so that my old age has been signally favored with respect both to
         external and internals; for which I

         of her life she dictated to her Son a short time before her end. She was much
         beloved and respected by all who knew her both here and at Duckenfield, and had
         proved a blessing to many. Soon after her arrival at
         Bayldon, she heard of an old lady, in one of whose
         tenements we had our former meeting place, one of our Brethren occupying the
         house; but being unfriendly and prejudiced against us. She gave us warning to
         quit the premises, which proved the occasions of our building the present small
         chapel and schoolhouse. Our late sister verified this lady and by means of her
         conversations gained her entire affection and confidence. The old lady became
         sensible of her lost condition, sought for grace a the commission of sins thro'
         the atoning blood of Jesus, which she also found and departed this life in peace.
         She was greatly interested in the prosperity of the Society at
         Bayldon, and when her son and the preacher, who
         occasionally attended there from Fulneck, where ready to
         lou converge â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹by the small number who came to the

         had been no increase to the Society, but rather a diminution in member, owing to
         the departure of several of the first member; she animated them to do their part
         faithfully, saying the Lord would not be wanting on his side, adding: "You will
         see (better) brighter days, after I am gone". 

*Their expectation was strikingly
         verified. At the funeral oration, previous to the interment, which I was favoured
         to deliver on May 15. 1799. I had the please to see all the seats in
         the chapel occupied, tho' it was at the early hour of 7 in the morning, to gain
         time for conveying her remains to Fulneck, where she wished
         to be interred, and which is at the distance of 8 miles. The numerous procession,
         which followed her by high and low in Bayldon. And when on Lord's Day, June
         9, I again officiated there, and previous to the afternoon sermon, read
         the above narration of her life, the meeting place was crowded and many stood
         before the door. From that time the preachings continued â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹to be numerously
         attended, so that the *

      <p> She had for many years been troubled with a violent cough, which sometimes
         deprived her of natural rest; yet she never murmured, lest her complaint be ever
         so great; but always prayed for resignation, and relied on Him, who had never
         forsaken or disappointed her.  Her son saying to her on the Day of her
         Departure: "My Dear mother, I wish our Savior would raise you
         up even more;" she replied: "Do not keep me back, let me go freely; it will be
         best for me now; I want to be gone and to see my Dear
         ,Savior." At noon, her son wishing her to take some  

*chapel was found too small, and the foundation stone for a new one was laid
         March.28.1806. The Society also increased. A few weeks after her
         Departure 8 new members were added to the same. At her Death their number was 17.
         Exactly as many as she found in connexion with the Brethren, other find coming to
         Bayldon. And when I left Yorkshire in 1804, their number was between
         40&lt;50. and I learn by letters that they continued to increase in number and
         grace. *

      <p> nourishment, she said:  "I've no mind for eating or for drinking, food,
         which might corrupt again; If God's bread that's heavenly I
         am thinking Jesus' flesh I would obtain, who was made man of
         the Lord of David, And his blood is drink, o how I crave it
         from earth's life to be set free in loves' immortality."  She added, "That is
         what I want." At 8 in the evening she found breathing very difficult. Her son
         looking at her with earnest concern, she turned her eyes to him, as it were, to
         comfort him and said:  "Tho' waves and storming o'er my head, tho health a
         strength a friend, be gone, shortness of breath preventing her from finishing this
         her favourite verse, she said to her son, go on; which he did as follows: 
         "Tho' joys be withered ill and fled, tho' every comfort be with withdrawn;
         stedfast on this my soul relies, Jesus, thy mercy never
         dies."  She joined in the last lines, and then said, that is it. For
         sometimes after this she continued labouring under great difficulty of breathing,
         and at length was very desirous to have her bed made. Being placed on

         put again into her own bed, she prayed intimately:
         "Dear Savior, come and fetch me thy poor sinner home; come,
         Dear Savior, and fetch me." Soon after this her son thought
         she had been asleep, but her breath grew shorter and shorter. Thus she expired in
         the most gentle and peaceful in manner and went over to see him, whom here she
         loved, and whom she also served to the utmost of
         her power, with great faithfulness. Her pilgrimage here
         below lasted 82 years 3 months and 3 days.  "She is
         now with the Son at home; our humble expectation is, that
         he'll let us also come, to join that congregation."
