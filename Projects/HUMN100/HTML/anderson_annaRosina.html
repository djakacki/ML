      <p> Our dear happily departed sister Anna Rosina Anderson, has left the following account of herself: I was born the 9th of Aug 1727 at Berthelsdorf. My Parents belonging to the Cong
         endeavoured to bring me up in the same connection with the Cong. and send me from my earliest years every Sunday to Herrnhut to the Children’s meeting, which the late Count
         Zinzendorf kept. He asked me many questions, and tho I did not always understand him, yet it
         made an impression on my heart and I felt a desire to be happy. When I was in my 7th
         year
         my father departed happily to our savior, after which the late Count took care of my mother and her children; She came to live in the widow’s house at
         Herrnhut.

      <p> and her children in the Orphan house, but I for my part had no inclination for it,
         but chose to stay with my Grand father in Berthelsdorf. After a few years my uncle in Lobenstein
         desired me to come and live with him, which I was very glad of. I was there above
         a year, but did not find it so agreeable as I thought, and I prayed many times with
         tears to the
         Lord, to help me away again, which he graciously did, For it happened at this time that
         the late Count came to Ebbersdorf and my uncle had an opportunity to see him; and told him
         that I was very unhappy here; on hearing this he took me under his care and sent me
         to Marienborn to the Orphan house I prayed to the Lord to preserve me here and make me happy,
         and that I never might come to any /// any other place except among the Brethren, because I was sometimes enticed by my uncle to go back with him to his home. At
         that time
         during a severe sickness which I get, I learned to pray earnestly for my happiness. I found many friends here
         who wished me well and to see me prosper for our savior; particularly
         one sister will always be remembered by me, who, when I had recovered, took me with
         her into the garden, and kneeling down with me, sent up a fervent prayer in my behalf
         to our
         Savior, which I shall never forget. But it was not sufficient to make me happy; because
         I must feel my savior's comfort and forgiveness for my own heart and this happiness in a very
         particular manner. Being once quite alone in a place I fell down at his feet and implored
         his mercy and forgiveness for all my sins through his precious blood. At that time,
         I felt
         something, which I cannot express, his comfort to my troubled soul and his mercy shown
         to one, 
      </p>

      <p> [illegible] In the year 1741 I was received into the Great Girls Choir and in the same year I enjoyed the holy Communion for the first time, which was an
         unspeakable blessing to my
         heart. At that time there was a company of great girls which the late Count took particular care of, he kept us Choir meetings and instructed us how to become
         useful in our
         Savior's service. I was appointed to keep the Children's and great girls bands , and enjoyed
         many blessings from our Savior, when we spoke together of his great love and mercy.
         Soon after I had the office of an assistant among /// the Children conferred upon me and moved in the same year with this Oeconomy to Herrnhaag. All these appointments
         taught me to come into closer connection with our Savior and showed me that I could do nothing of myself. His mercy and love shown to me bowed
         me in the dust before him. I had the
         confidence to cleave to him as a poor sinner, and believed he would help me thro'.
         1743 I was accepted an acoluth with a large company, which encouraged me anew to live
         to him and
         serve him as a poor Child that has nothing to plead but his mercy from day to day.
         1744 I was received into the Single Sisters Choir and 1747 blessed for a Deaconess. 1748 I received
         a Call to be Single Sister Laboress at Bethlehem in America. In London February the 10th I was blessed for my office and set out in June. Sept the 20th I arrived in Bethlehem after
         a troublesome voyage. I cannot but take nothat this year the 13th of November was celebrated the first time in 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 4 </h3>
      <p> America, which brought the first impression of that in Herrnhaag 1741 very fresh to my mind, but I was sorry, I could not enjoy it in such a manner as
         I wished to do. I had to
         struggle, particularly in the beginning with many difficulties, being young and unexperienced,
         and had no body to whom I could open my heart and consult with, so as I wished; which
         made it sometimes very heavy to me. But my dear savior helped me through whenever I turned to him in my distress. I visited frequently in
         the most of the country congress which lay
         very distant from each other. In the year 1755 a war broke out between the French and English, and as the indians generally took
         share and joined one of the other party, we had
         very difficult time at Bethlehem and Nazareth. First the settlement of the Brethren at the Mahony about /// 27 miles from Bethlehem was destroyed by the Indians, where 11
         Brothers and Sisters lost their lives, after which many murders were committed much
         nearer, till at last within 6 miles of Bethlehem. We knew that we were closely watched by the
         Indians who would gladly have destroyed the place which at that time was the only
         one capable of making any resistance to their Incursion. The reports of their cruelties
         at other
         places kept us in continual alarm and apprehension, particularly as Indians were sometimes observed to lurk about and in the place at
         nights. However the strict watch kept by the
         Brethren in many parts and particularly about our house but above all the protection of our good Lord, always frustrated their designs. During all these heavy times, our dear Lord
         was our only comfort and his peace
      </p>

      <p> was very sensibly felt amongst us. In the year 1762Nathanael Seidel arrived here from Europe, who had lately been married to Anne Joh. Piesch an old acquaintance of mine; from
         whose conversation and support I received much comfort. In the year 1764 I received a call to return to Europe, Susanna de Gersdorf arrived early in that year to supply my place,
         and I left Bethlehem in company with Mr and Mrs Boehler and some other Mr and Mrs in the beginning of May. We had a very quick passage, arrived in London the 24th of June; and at
         Marienborn here the Synod was assembled on the 4th of July. After the Synod was closed I went to Herrnhut and in the year 1765 received a call to serve the choir's in England. I
         first went to Fulneck, where I stayed about a year, and then got a call to Bedford, where I served the single Srs until the year 1772 when /// I returned again to Fulneck. To
         go any further in relating my course I don't think needful. Our savior passion and death and that he has redeemed me poor sinner with his own precious blood,
         is to me above
         everything in time and in eternity. He has helped me through this vale of tears and
         given me grace to place my confidence in him in which I never have been put to shame.
         When I have
         the favor to see him face to face I shall kiss his feet with sinner tears for all
         his mercy bestowed upon me Thus far has this faithful handmaid of Jesus left us an account of
         herself and of what the lord has done for her soul. There could be much to say of all the periods of grace; where
         with he has crowned her endeavours and helped her services to so
         many souls, in devising, comforting and showing them the way to their hap

      <p> [illegible] Her character and the blessing which attended the Labour is known and
         acknowledged with thankfulness and we heavily wish and pray that we may follow her
         footsteps. In
         the year 1772 when she the second time arrived in Fulneck the choir and economies in Yorkshire were in a very hopeful state and she was received by them with the utmost audacity both
         of body and mind, deeming it her highest privilege to win souls for christ. The weakened
         of the flock were always objects of her peculiar care and concern, and she spared
         no pains
         what was in tending and bearing them in love; and in such instances when all means
         /// proved insufficient, it was evident to all around her, how she always bemoaned their
         loss. On the other hand our Savior gave her the satisfaction to see many faithful handmaids, whom she had raised up
         for the Lord, enter into the different services of his house,
         which she always looked upon as the greatest favor conferred on herself. As the Choir here in Fulneck considerably increased it was in the year 1780 taken into consideration to
         build a house in Wyke, and the proposal having been approved of, our late sister had
         the pleasures to assist in laying the foundation stone, which was a blessed solemnity. When it
         was furnished and inhabited by sisters from Fulneck she used to visit them frequently with great faithfulness, and took particular share
         in their weal and woe; as also in the
         welfare of the sisters economies at Gummersall, Mirfield and Littlemore; when several years ago the latter was given up, it was a great concern to her mind.

      <p> [illegible] lot of grace and enjoy the blessings and privileges, which were so precious
         to herself. For us to her own person she regretted exceedingly, that in her latter
         days old
         age and weakness prevented her attending every opportunity for dedication and encouragement
         as much as she wished to do. May the 1st 1802 she was seized with a paralytic stroke, but
         recovered so far again that she on the 4th of may could attend the meetings /// in our house. During this winter, her weakness increased and she was much confined to her room.
         February 15th 1803she had another stroke, which quite took away the uses of her right side, and, the next day she had strong convulsions so that we all expected her dissolution .
         She had often expressed a wish for Benade to pray with her at her departure which
         was now done, and after the prayer the blessing of the Lord was pronounced over her. The feeling
         of the peace of god on this occasion will leave a deep impression on the minds of all who were
         present. After the first paroxysm she fell asleep and slumbered for the most part
         but
         when she between times awoke she seemed to be sensible, though her speech was so far
         gone, that she could only say yes or no to the questions asked. The 18th some sisters
         assembled
         in her room to sing some verses expressing our foretaste of that happy cod to be at home

      <p> with the Lord; she seemed quite delighted with it and kept awake the whole time. The 19th in the afternoon she appeared more
         collected than before and could speak several words,
         and when the girls came to see her, she gave them all the hand and said: The Lord
         bless you. Afterwards she slumbered again till about evening, had a very restless
         night, and the
         20th in the morning about 7 o' clock her redeemed and through the blood of Jesus sanctified
         soul went gently and happy over into the arms of her beloved bridegroom, during the singing of
         that verse: When in the arms of Jesus, thy lips shall pallid grow. Her age was 75
         years and 6 months.
