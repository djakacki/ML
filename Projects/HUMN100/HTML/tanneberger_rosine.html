      <p> II. The married Sist. Rosine Taneberger. She was Ao 1708 born at Mammendorf in Moravia. Her Vaters name was Geo. Weber. The holy ghost had from her tender youth his work in heart
         &amp; she spent her time  continually without Rest in her soul. In her 25th. year of Age she married Michel Taneberger. she [has] 2 Boys with him but they died very young. She very
         often pineth to hear the  Gospel of Jesus Sufferings of Death, therefore she very begged dear God to still her Desire &amp; help her to a Place where she could find rest for her poor soul
         , then she could not find that in her Mother Country. Ao 1753. the 13th October She got a feeling in her heart to move to Gnadenfrey, they hastened as much as possible &amp;
         escaped hardly from their pursuers. The 31 of Dec. she arrived here very much rejoiced. Soon after a critical occasion pretty nearly
         persuadeth her husbands to remove from here to
         his son. She therefore was so embarrassed &amp; intreated our Serviour in her Perplexity saying: feared my heart catched a spark of grace, &amp; instead to become a fire he will be
         quenched!
