      <p> I Sam.l Tippett have thought it might not be amiss to leave
         the following lines behind me I was Born in the year of our Lord in
         1711 In the Parrish of Bitton, in the
         Hamlet of Oland My Father died when I was young, my mother kept me to
         school tho with some difficulty, For I was of a light turn of mind and giving very
         much to play with other Boys which made my mother pretty sharp with me, Tho at
         some times I should have sarious thoughts and think what will become of me when I
         die and should wish I had never been born or died when I had been at my mothers
         breast, Then I thought I should went to Heaven, But who knows what will become of
         me now, I have been such a bad Boy, and told so many lies, and said nasty words,
         and many of the like thoughts would come into my mind, Then I should think to be
         better and not do so nomore, and often wish I had one or two little Boys of my
         mind to go to Church and to be good and to live a Religious life, and did often
         times wish I had liv'd in the days of our Saviour, and think how I wou'd have
         lov'd Him and follow'd him had it been even to death, so that when I did Read of
         His death and sufferings. I should melt into tears, so that I was fors't to give
         over Reading, although it was the only place that I did love to Read in; But once
         above all the rest as I was rocking the cradle looking in 
      </p>

      <p> a little Book as I met with by chance I felt something in my Heart that I never
         felt before, and had it been possible I cou'd then even sunk
         into nothing in tears of love before the Lord Jesus
         and the Covenant that I made with Him that evening I though then to have kept to
         all the days of my Life, But this soon wear'd of, and for want of care taken as I
         grew biger my corruped nature grew stronger and stronger and led me more and more
         captive, at Ten years of age or these about I went to work in
         the Coal Pitt amongs't other other bad Boys, though my Mother porswade
         my to go a Prentis but I cou'd not bear the though of loosing my companion, and be
         confind, But as I grew in years older and older at last I thought to make my self
         happy in what the world called merry company, But twas all in vain, for I was disapointed in every thing that I did take in hand,
         So that often times in the midts of mirth I should have such heapiness of spirit come upon me that I did not know what to do, some
         times I did endeavour to pass it away by singing or Dancing or such like, and some
         times leave my company, and think if I was with 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 4 </h3>
      <p> with other company then perhaps i should be better satisfied, but this would not
         do for twas all in vain, for when i was coming home my heart would begin to smite
         me. thinking where have i been and what will become of me if i go on at this rate,
         then i should make many resolutions not to do no more of beg of lord to forgive
         me, but in a few days all my resolutions would be broken and i should think it is
         fine enough if for me to turn may live a great while, i am but young if as my
         father died in of consumption to may i an then it will be time enough to represent
         if turn to the lord but this would not satisfy my poor mind long together, for
         when my thoughts of dying suddenly or being killed in if did come in mind i did
         not know what to do, but should beg of lord to spare me a little longer, for i
         could not bear thoughts of leaving world in of condition i was then in, this i
         went on for many years together sinning if responding striving to get happiness in
         my pleasures of this life is positive but i was all in vain, for i was
         disappointed in all my 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 5 </h3>
      <p> ways that I did think to get happiness in, abought this time I
         goot aguainted with my dear wife and was maried into the year
         1736 by whome I have had Eleven Children, For the first two
         years and more I went on in my old cource of life with my merry Company thinking
         by &amp; by it will be better, but I new not how for I was
         disapointed in every thing and all that I took in hand seem'd to make
         against me; that I knew not which way I shou'd come through in the world about
         this time Mr. Whitfield came in these parts and I went to
         hear him at a place cal'd Hannam Mount, He spoke of the
         Prodigal son returning to his Father and of our fall by nature and how willing
         Jesus Christ was to receive every returning sinner, He
         painted my case and condition as tho he new me from the very bottom, and envited
         all such poor sinners to Jesus Christ in a loving manner, I
         thought this was to good news to be believ'd that ever he cou'd receive or look
         upon such a poor reck as I was who had been fighting against him 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 6 </h3>
      <p> all the days of my life, But this seem'd as a Hook in my Heart for some days, Tho
         I was asham'd to let any one know anything about
         it, But I thought if this be true there is nothing in all the world shall hinder
         me till I know he have receiv'd me, if he will except of the such a poor sinner as
         I am, soon after this hear'd Mr
         Sennick under the secumore Tree near Mr
         Wesleys scool it being the first or second time of his preaching,
         But I had not been there many minutes but my heart was all most ready to break, He
         spoke from the first chapter of Saint John and something of his own experience
         which came near my heart thinking to my self what shall I do to be sav'd, my sins
         as if weare steard me in the face, my companians and all I thought wou'd be
         witness against me at the Last Day, and as I had not been the ruination of my own
         poor soul but theirs also, and now I was a mark for every one to laugh at, and
         many more of the like expression was the languige of my poor heart for the whole
         sermon I stood in amaze asham'd to look anyone in the face thinking no ones
         condition like mine in the whole world, but yet thought how glad I shou'd be if I
         cou'd but get aquainted with that man and look'd after him till he was gone out of
         my sight, But in less then a fortnight I and two more

      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 7 </h3>
      <p> went to Bristol and I inquired where he lied and got him
         over to Kingswood with us that night, He slept at my House
         and I never thought my self so happy in all my former
         compoany as I did when I was along with him, if often did on bosom my mind into
         him as my only friend, but about this time I heard Mr Wesloy
         preach up a self denial life, how we should live and walk which put me to work I
         caused me many akin heart after word, so that I did often times with I could never
         eat drink nor sleep no more until I did know the Lord Jesus
         did love me I had forgiven me my sins, then I was confirmed went to the sacrament
         thinking to find ease there, but I found it quite to the contrary, for this added
         to my trouble that I was more condonned than ever thinking no ones condition like
         mine in the whole world,tossed to and forget rest for my poor heart but could find
         none, and was often times making of resolutions to get into the woods, or to some
         retired place where I might spend the rest of my days and never eat nor drink no
         more till I did know that Jesus Christ did love me, but in
         this I was also disappointed for go where I would if
         uneasiness of my heart and the thoughts of leaving this world that know I should
         be saved would make me in such a 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 8 </h3>
      <p> condition that I did not know what to do with myself. The some times in midst of
         all although would dash into my mind, who knows but I shall be said at last,
         perhaps if Lord do love me he have promised to save such ones as in my condition
         therefore I will never rest free I know that he have said me, about this time I
         and four more was taken into a band by Mr Sennick at
         Mr Wesloy, scool where we met constant together every week
         for some time I not without a lifeliving, about this time I was very near like to
         be killed two or three times in the pitt and by some other accident, if one of the
         times my hurt was pretty bad not I thought has spard my life if not called me away
         in the condition I was then in though of if same time I did not know that any one
         had any thing to righteous life, I fasted two or three times every week, I prayed
         perhaps ten or twenty times every day as after as I had opportunity, I went to my
         sacrament every month, Every hour that I did steps I did think twas time lost, and
         did often times wish I could never sleep no more, my countenance did betray my
         poor miserable heart, some times with heats a sigh would bust from my heart O that
         I did but know if Lord Jesus, or was afraid of his love

      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 9 </h3>
      <p> to my poor heart, though sometimes between while a thought would dart into my
         mind who knows but I shall be saved at last perhaps jesus do love me. if one
         promise after another would come into my mind that my very heart would leap for
         day but soon after i should give all over and think it was something of my own
         making and getting into my old course of duties as before, till at last i was a
         weary of my left righteous life, for if more i did strive of faster i was so that
         i did not love to hear so much of simple doings for i found it was all nothing but
         stuff and with a full determination thought if i porrith i will porrith at of feel
         of jesus as a poor sinner, for i was a sensible that nothing could satisfy my poor
         heart but Him, and about this time as I was in a coal pitt making my complaint to
         if Lord Jesus as I use to do had i but a minute time, but all of a sudden it was
         as though he spoke to me i am could if do love thee but what if i felt in my heart
         that moment words who felt in my hear that moment words all my uneasiness of heart
         was gone in a moment, and Him whom i looked upon before as being angry with me i
         found was my best friend in the whole world that it been possible i could then.

      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 10 </h3>
      <p> even sunk into nothing or went home to him that very moment, this lasted upon and
         down with me for some time until the wickedness of my Heart began to appear, which
         made me think I had decieved myself, though at times I did feel to the contract I
         could not give it up, about this as perfection reprobation and and if like which
         put me to reasoning often times made me uneasy in my mind whom I did enter upon
         them, we had several meetings to try to reconcile it but to no purpose, for in a
         little time Brother Sennick and twenty four more of us was
         put out along with him out of the society, we went to look a little room where we
         did meet together every evening and had a pretty feeling amongst us, until at last
         our number increased so fast that the place we had taken was to little to hold us
         so that when we had a love feast for want the room we was forced to keep it in the
         open fields and the spirit of love was felt amongst us, so that many of those that
         did stand of at distance at the outside of hedges that did not belong to us did
         not go away without a blessing, but as winter was coming on Brother
         Sennick was resould to build a school house, bought a piece of
         ground and had it covered before winter though there was many operations made 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 11 </h3>
      <p> against it, there is together in love and our saviour was other times feeling in
         my mind we was soon form'd into classes or bands by who we look'd upon as our
         chief labourer that went in and out before you, my heart felt well at that time so
         that i could keep band with our saviour as though there was but he and i in of
         whole world, but some time after this brethren cennik plan began to get wider in
         Willtshear of many other places, so that he could not be so much at kingswood as
         before so that many others was in place when he was absent, the enemy seeing that
         we was like to come to something soon found out away to put a stop to our
         happiness by something up dochins of many other truths an of place of Jesus Christ
         this offer times make me heavy if conserved when i began to see what confusion was
         creeping in amongst us, but in ye year i went to london with br connick there i
         heard brother gomball, rogers, hutton, it was in some of brother company several
         times while i stayed there which often times made me wish to see your spirit of
         love and hearing of kingswood as i say was amongst them, but after i came home
         instead of seeing it better it grew worse 
      </p>

      <p> if worse, so that our number which was in the society of about 80 or so was soon
         reduced to 50 or so, this caused me pain, and made me make my complain to our savior
         as though there
         was but he and I in the whole world, out reaching was all dropped and I knew not what
         if end of it would be, then I with the consent of 2 or 3 more wrote to Brother and
         begged that
         they would come and labour among'st us, and their answer was get they did not see
         their call quite clear from our savior but so soon as they did they would gladly run
         to our
         assistance, four or five brother of us met together every sunday morning making our
         complaint- one to another and our dear saviour was often times near our hearts, and
         sunday
         afternoon our little society of about 20 or 30 did meet together and thus we went
         on together for sometime, being look'd upon as a stubborn people that a mark for every
         one to laugh
         at as for my own part i meet with many trials on every ride, my nearest kindred was
         set against me and those that before was my bosom friends forsook me and look'd upon
         me with
         disdain, this and many more to mention made me often times make my

      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 13 </h3>
      <p> Complaint to the Lord Jesus, Looking upon my self as having
         no friend in the whole world but Him to make my complaint to and had not his dear
         nearness often times comforted my Poor Heart I could not have come through in
         these troublesome times, I continu'd writing to the Brethren as often as
         Opportunity arriv'd because it was so in my Heart could I but be under their came
         I should be then in my right place, In the years 46 Mr Steele
         one of the Brethren came to Kingswood &amp; Preach'd in
         Cennicks Scool House, &amp; in my Evening I {ac}cept a Harty Band with him
         conserning the many things that had happen'd amongs't us, But just after I parted
         from him not far from the place where our Chapple stands I had such a feeling of
         our Saviours Love that I stood still in amaze{ment} &amp; said Dear Savior how is
         this that I feel in my Heart so much Love to these People power'd out my whole
         Heart to Him in a child like manner &amp; pray'd that He would keep me in the
         storm 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 14 </h3>
      <p> That I say was comin upon me, Soon after this Mr Horn which
         was the labourer at Wilshear came &amp; Preach'd twice in
         Cennick school, and I felt my Heart united to Him &amp;
         tould him the many disputes that had been a- mongst us, And our Saviour blessed
         our conversation that it was as though a Burden had been taken from me, or as a
         prisoner set free Especially when he told me as I might look upon my self as under
         their care &amp; that our saviour had made it out that they should come once a
         month &amp; labour amongs't us, this was agreeable news to me, &amp; to many of
         those that did meet along with me, But in a few weeks Them that had left us
         disputed about Cennciks right to the school because He was
         gone to the Brethren &amp; took it away by violence without Brother
         Cennicks knowing any thing about it, Then after that was
         taken away from us we remov'd to Brother Cennicks own house
         where his sister then lived, &amp; though our company was but small yet we had
         many pretty opportunities to the satisfaction of many Heart, But the Enemy not
         willing to leave no stone onturn'd soon 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 15 </h3>
      <p> found out away to drive us from there also, then by of advice of Mr
         Horn, if to that did alright us from wilshear we removed meetings to
         my own house where we continued for some time with many blessings, and in a year
         we was visited by many of our Joannas Nichman,
         Bealer, Marshall,
         Colast, HornSennick of many others by whom my heart was refreshed if
         comforted many a time about this time my mother went home she was one of our
         society and she expressed her happiness to one of our sister of right before,
         which was last that she spoke with, soon after this by of consent of the Brother
         we removed our meeting into her House, where we continued for some years, and
         though it was but a little house and our company small yet our saviour's sweet
         nearness was felt amongst us which did often make my poor heart blush for shame,
         and allow hardily do I with this happy

      <p> Feeling to all those that are taken up with so many things besides
         Jesus Christ, and as yet do not see Him the one thing need
         full, In the year 1754the Disciple came to Bristoll
         wherein I had an opportunity to tell Him how I felt my Heart towards the Brethren
         for many years past, and that I was willing to cast my lot with them above all
         people in the whole world, He tould me I should &amp; accordingly gave me leave to
         write to him when he return'd to London, There in I
         expres't my mind more fuller, some- time after then I had leave to go to
         London &amp; to be at the Synod at
         Chelsy House which proved a blessing to my heart &amp; at times I shall
         never forget what I say heard &amp; felt, Heare I must stop with a blushing face
         before our saviour &amp; thank him with a thousand Tears that ever twas my lot to
         be brought to those people who preach the Torments of Jesus,
         whose lives is not dear to them so they can but bring souls to him &amp; be Happy,
         January the 26th 1755 the Congregation
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 17 </h3>
      <p> was setl'd at Bristoll a Day that I long'd with to see for
         many years, and had my lot to be one amongs't the rest This was a Day that had it
         been possible I cou'd have sunk into nothing for shame and unworthiness before my
         Dear Savior who have done so much for me &amp; brought me to His people at last
         with home I am determined to spend the rest of my days was it at the loss of all
         things or let the consequence be what it will, so I have good but his sweet
         nearness to support me thats enough for me, In the following year August the
         22 {17}56 it was agreed upon to have a Chappell &amp;
         Burring Ground at Kingwood which I had often times wish to see before I
         went home, and accordinly he have granted my request in that and many things more
         for which I thank Him Hartilly and now what my poor Heart have felt in that place
         I wish to all those that shall hear my dear brethren 
      </p>
      <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Page 18 </h3>
      <p> After my decease, For I wish well to His cause poor &amp; needy as I am, and do
         Daily pray that I may have him near my poor heart while I am hear, For I have no
         friend in this world that I can unburden my mind to as I can write him, for the
         older i get the more trouble I meet with, so that I have more need of him now then
         ever and do often times wish that I could lose myself in his company &amp; never
         dispart from him no more, For when i feel his sweet nearness I want nothing else
         but to be lost in Him and the outward circumstances &amp; family affairs have
         taken up to much of my time &amp; caused me pain, yet my best friend is faithfull
         unto me, &amp; in his due time will put all these things to right, In the meantime
         while I am hear below may that be my chief concern to have him near my poor Heart
         in my old years &amp; then it will all end well
