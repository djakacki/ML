         Brief Memoir 
         of the late happily departed Sister
         Harriett Lees,
         who fell asleep in Jesus
         on the 17th of January 1842 aged 30 - 
         and was interred in the Burying Ground
         adjacent to the Chapel of the United Brethren
         in Leominster.
         //
         Our late sister was born on the 11th of February 
         1811 at the Woodford cum Membris in the county of 
         Northampton; she was brought up in the 
         principles and doctrines of the established
         Church of England and by a pious mother 
         was early trained in the path of virtue, and 
         though she lost her mother in early age, yet
         the impressions she had perceived from that 
         mother's good advice, teaching her children
         to be punctual at Church and in the reading 
         of the word of God were never forgotten,
         and were a source of great blessing to her where
         subsequently the Holy Spirit led her to see
         herself as a poor sinner, and to flee to 
         Christ for mercy. - Our late Sister frequently

         in her prayers that she might have 
         some gracious Light thrown upon her mind, 
         and be assured that her brother was accepted.
         Through the merits of a crucified and Risen
         Saviour. Upon opening her Bible after earnest
         prayer, the first text that met her eager eye was
         Luke 3 ch 2' verse. "and the Lord said unto Satan, 
         the Lord rebuke thee oh Satan, even the Lord that
         hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee; is not this 
         a brand plucked out of the fire"-- From that 
         time she never experienced the slightest doubt of
         her brother's happiness, but spoke of him ever
         after with the greatest satisfaction. --. 11th of August 
         she writes, "This is dear, brother William's birthday. 
         last year he was well and happy as ourselves,
         receiving our congratulations, this, he is in the 
         silent grave, but is he not also in heaven
         singing the praises of that Lamb who died to
         save all poor sinners! if so, how much happier 
         than we! Can be with him here again. happy 
         should I be to join him of my dear Savior
         would see fit to call me".-- On the morning
         of the 14th of August on her hearing of her Father, Sister
         and friend, who went to a neighboring village

         the evening before, being thrown out of their 
         gig and very much hurt, she remarks,
         "Oh what a day is this, called upon to hear
         of another accident, but God in his great
         mercy has not seen fit that this should
         be a fatal one- He will not lay upon us 
         more than we can bear. Oh may he have 
         mercy upon the poor suffered, my Father,
         sister and friend. August the 17th the day her
         surviving partner left after having been on a 
         visit, she says, "May God he, always be, with 
         the friend of my dear brother". Her last 
         observation she has left behind her in
         reference to this subject, was on the 23 of 
         August, when she writes, "Eight weeks have
         elapsed since that melancholy event which 
         deprived me of a dearest brother. Oh how 
         rapid is the flight of time! soon will it 
         bring me to him! happy then will be our
         meeting, since, then the fear of another
         separation can no more distant our
         happiness. ----                   From that time 
         her treasure was in heaven, and she took 
         every opportunity of attending the preaching
         of the Gospel both of church and Chapel,

         and often explored the comfort and 
         happiness she experienced in the house of
         God . --    Her health was delicate and she 
         was often subject to bad colds attended
         by severe cough. -- In the spring of 
         1837 she had a violent inflammation of 
         the lungs which no doubt sowed the
         seeds of the pulmonary complaint
         which caused her pilgrimage thro’ time to
         be cut off in the bloom of life. ---
         The following summer she was advised
         to try the waters at Leamington, which
         were of great benifit benefit to her, and she 
         appeared, tho’ still delicate, to be likely to 
         regain her former good health.-
         On recovering from one of her bad attacks
         of cold, in a letter to her partner she
         writes, “I am fully sensible that afflictions
         are at all times sent for our good, and 
         may he who in infinite wisdom sees fit
         to send them, sanctify them into us,
         and enable us to make a right use of
         them, and if they are the means of 
         bringing us more earnestly to seek after
         the things which belong to our everlasting

         peace, and draw our affections from the
         vanities of this world, to the joys of heaven 
         and a Saviour's love, and teach us strictly
         to examine our wicked and deceitful hearts,
         best we should suffer ourselves to be deceived
         by them, they will prove with rich blessings;
         for though they may weaken the casket, they
         will refine the Jewels within, and at
         length we shall be enabled from the heart
         to say, it was good for us to be afflicted"
         On the 4th of June 1838 she was joined
         in holy matrimony to her surviving partner
         13th. Br. William Lees of Leominster- After a residence
         of a few months in that place, she was at 
         her own earnest request admitted a member
         of the Brn's Church, at a communion Lovefeast
         and having been a regular communicant in
         the Established Church, she partook of the
         Holy Sacrament at the same time. - She always
         spoke of this as being a season of much
         blessedness, and ever considered it a special
         leading of our Saviour, to bring her into a 
         fold of which Jesus alone is acknowledged to be
         the chief Shepherd and Head.---

      <p>The following May when her respected
         Father in law Mr. Lees was called home in such
         an awfully sudden manner, she was generously
         supported and enabled to speak comfort to her
         distressed partner, leading him with much
         tenderness and simplicity to look forward to
         the hope set before us in the Gospel, that
         if faithful to the end we should meet him
         in Heaven. Our marriage was blessed in the
         following December by the birth of a son -
         this, with the pure air of Leominster seemed
         to have wrought a change for the better in
         her constitution but her gracious Saviour
         had higher intentions for her than to
         continue long a sojournn  soujourn in this vale of
         tears,- the next winter she was again
         much troubled with her cough, and
         the medical attendant who was called in
         to see her whilst suffering under a severe
         attack of cold accompanied by a distressing
         cough, gave it as his opinion, that seeds
         of consumption had evidently been sown,
         and were beginning to produce bad effects
         which caused ever afterwards great anxiety in
         the minds of all her friends.

      <p>The death of her sister Charlotte last summer, seemed to
         impress upon her mind the idea that it would not be long before she would be
         called home.- She suffered very
         much during the last 3 months of her pilgrimage thro' time,
         from weakness and her violent cough, but was always
         cheerful, and never complained, but expressed her
         confidence that the Saviour who had hitherto supported would continue to be her
         strength.- her married sister came to stay a few weeks with her early in
         December which was a source of great
         pleasure to her, -her spirits and cheerfulness tho' on the eve of her confinement were particularly
         noticed by all around her. When the weather was not fit for her to go to
         Chapel, and she was recommended to stay at home, her
         answer always was, "I am able to go, the Lord blesses any soul more than the
         effort injures my feeble frame", nor would she ever
         miss as long as she had strength to go. When her sister in law Mrs. C
         Lees married again last January she understood her
         Tract

         District and missionary subscribes in the
         Town, and tho' often poorly, her Saviour
         gave her strength to do his work, and 
         she often expressed the enjoyment she had
         in her visits among the poor, supplying
         them with the food of eternal life, and
         many gave her great pleasure by the
         thankfulness with which they received the 
         tracts. - The last day our dear sister
         was permitted to attend the Chapel, was at
         the Lovefeast on Christmas day, which she
         enjoyed very much.- she was quite overcome
         when she returned home and said "this is
         the last time I shall go for the present." 
         On the 29th of December, she was safely and most
         mercifully delivered of a second son, and the
         strong arm of the Lord was so whom her 
         during the time of nature's trial, that she
         spoke of it afterwards, that had she seen
         her Saviour bodily present, she could not
         have felt his support more  than she did.
         The first few days she seemed to be doing
         remarkably well, but afterwards she did not
         gain strength, whilst of the same time

      <p> she lost her appetite, which she attributed to a very
         painful affection in her and from which she suffered
         much. The Surgeon administered some medicine
         which greatly relieved her, and her anxious friends then hoped she would go on
         well, but it was otherwise ordered, for on the Thursday previous to her departure
         she was taken with a fainting fit producing hysterics
         -- by the means used she soon recovered and became comfortable again, and would insist on her husband's attending the anniversary meeting of the Sunday schools which was
         held that evening.-The next morning her medical attendant informed her friends
         that she was suffering from severe disease on her
         lungs, and that she was in great, tho' not immediate danger, and if the
         disease could be kept down to allow her to gain strength she might be partially
         restored. When it was mentioned to her she exclaimed, "I am in the Lord's hands,
         he has abundantly helped me, and if it is his will he will do so now, but if not,
         He will take me to him self tho' such a poor sinner-- Her only anxiety seemed to be, that if she got better, she should

         never be able to do much for her baby, her
         husband and her little boy of whom she was
         doatingly fond. She seemed according to all
         appearances, to be gradually improving in strength,
         during Saturday and Sunday tho' exceedingly weak,
         and she enjoyed the company of her friends very
         much, especially on Sunday-- On Sunday morning,
         when the texts of the day read to her, she was 
         much cheered and struck with the Doctrinal text,
         from Cor: 9 ch: 26, " I therefore so pure, not as uncertainly,
         so fight I, not as one that beateth the air".  "Help us
         to obtain the prize, "Help us well to close our race"
         On Monday morning, after a good night's rest, 
         she took leave of her sister, who was obliged to 
         return home, in the most cheerful manner,
         and her cheerfulness throughout that day was
         most remarkable, -- but who can understand 
         the mysterious ways of the Almighty. - 
         After taking her tea, setting up in her bed, 
         which she had enjoyed very much, she fell
         back on her pillow, apparently in a fainting
         fit, - as long as she had strength, she gave
         directions as to the remedies to be applied,
         but these, and the medicines given by the

         Doctor who was instantly called in, failed
         of the desired effect, and in a few moments
         the vital spark fled with scarcely a struggle, 
         and she was wafted by Angels to those
         heavenly mansions, prepared for her, where
         her Saviour had prepared for her an ever
         lasting crown, and she is now joining the 
         blessed chorus above, singing, "Worthy is the Lamb
         
         that was slain"- Her childlike confidence in 
         her Saviour, her mild and amiable disposition,
         and esteem of all who knew her, and will
         never be forgotten. As Wife, Sister, Friend and
         Mother, - Where was such another?- The loss to 
         her afflicted partner and children, can only be
         supplied by the Gracious Father, who has taken
         out of this role of tears this his handmaiden
         in early life- Oh may it lead us all to place
         our only hopes on that firm Rock on which
         our happily departed Sister built, and in life
         and in death put over trust in Him,
         according to the hymn No 630, which she used
         to delight in - "When by adversity I'm tried-
         "In God my Rock I will confide- Midst trials what-
         soe'er they be- Rely on his fidelity.-
