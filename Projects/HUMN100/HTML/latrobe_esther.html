         Brief - Memoir of our late happily
         departed Sister Esther Latrobe drawn
         up by her Husband and Brother
      </p>
      <p>
Our late dear Relative was born at Bristol June the 7th 1802, and being the only daughter among a family of six children, was peculiarly precious to her parents and brothers, and tenderly beloved by them.
      </p>
      <p>This tender affection and endearment
         was always returned by her with a warmth
         of feeling, which evinced to her family, her
         deep attachment towards them, and the gratitude heart to them for their love.
      </p>
      <p>She was very early subject of sickness
         and pain. In her childhood by occasion of the
         measles, which struck into her chest, she was
         brought to the brink of the grave and her family and medical attendants at that time had
         lost all hope of her life. It pleased the
         Lord, however to manifest in her case, His
         Power as the Preserver of man, and her life
         
      </p>

         was redeemed from destruction. At this period
         already, the grace of the Lord Jesus was producing
         in her conduct the buddings of that patient
         endurance of suffering, which was afterward
         exhibited in blossom and in fruit. Her meek
         submission under pain was a wonder to many,
         and her physician frequently expressed his 
         astonishment, that a child of her tender
         frame and years, would exhibit such lamb-
         like patience, under the pain he knew
         she was enduring. When she was just 
         eleven years old, she experienced another 
         severe trial from the hand of the Lord, by
         the death of her dear Mother. In common
         with the other member's of her father's
         house, she felt this bereavement keenly, and
         often wept in after-life at the remembrance of her loss. Indeed the loss was in 
         some respect peculiar to her, as a daughter,
         and the only one; -- yet the Lord graciously made
         it up to her, as she felt and feelingly 
         acknowledged, by the fond cares of those whom
         he still left her, and by the kindness of many
         kindness dear friends, not immediately

      <p>    
         belonging to her own family. 
         
      </p>
      <p>She spent the years of her schooling
         partly in Bristol under the care of Sister Bird
         and subsequently at Tytherton. The latter
         place was very dear to her; where she lived
         a great and interesting part of her pilgrim--
         age, and there she found rest to her soul in the 
         atoning merit of her Saviour. 
      </p>
      <p>Brother and Sister West were as parents 
         to her, and she became the intimate friend of 
         their eldest daughter. This was an attachment formed and maintained in the Lord, and
         we have reason to believe that our dear
         Relative often and frequently felt is to be for 
         her good, a strengthening of her hands in
         God. During these years, she was brought
         again to the verge of eternity, by means of 
         a rheumatic fever, and a violent affection or 
         palpitation of the heart. Again did her medical attendants give her up and her sorrowing 
         friends despaired of her life, but yet once more
         was the Lord's hand stretched forth to save 
         her, and she was restored to her family.

      <p>                
         They received her again as one raised from the
         dead, and she consequently became still more
         dear and precious to them all. These alarming 
         sicknesses were evidently blessed to her soul,
         they were means and times of grace to her.
      </p>
      <p>She was led to search and try her ways, and to 
         seek the Lord with full purpose of heart 
         and he was graciously found of her. Knowing
         now the end of our dear relative, we can trace
         clearly the good hand of our Lord in all these
         dispensations; we can see how he purified
         her, and made her fit for his service, and meet
         for an early possession of the inheritance
         incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth
         not away. We are enabled to read and to describe exactly the state of her heart; for she 
         has felt behind her, in writing, a few of those
         meditations and prayers, in which doubtless
         she often engaged, under the eye alone of
         her unseen Friend. She writes under 
         date of Tytherton - May 12th, 1824: --
         "May this year be remembered by me, 
         as long as my gracious Creator permits 
         me to remain on this earth. I have

         "indeed lived almost for 22 years. But what
         "have I been doing? Alas! I have done 
         "these things I ought not to have done.
         I have been an unprofitable servant.
         yet I feel my Saviour is both able and
         willing to love to the uttermost all
         who ask his forgiveness, and put their
         trust in Him. Oh! gracious permission, 
         the Lord that's in heaven, permit his poor creatures Him Father to call! I have today partaken with this congregation of the body and 
         blood of my ever blessed Saviour- What a favour
         bestowed on us so unworthy of such a feast, and 
         so inattentive to the voice of the Holy Spirit. 
         Help me ever merciful Savior to be more
         attentive in future to all thy invitations and 
         ordinances, more forgiving to my neighbours, 
         not easily offended. Teach me to bear and forbear
         and above all, to be more and more thankful
         for thy atonement, thy long suffering and tender 
         mercies. Teach me to know myself. Let me
         feel more humble. Yea, Lord, teach me now
         what to pray for. I can do nothing without thee,
         "Now, then, the sequel is well weighed to"

      <p>August 17th.-- She says-- Lord I must
         blushing stand when considering what an ungrateful creature I am. How often the means thou
         hast appointed for worshipping Thee, have been
         neglected by me. I do indeed attend at thy house
         of prayer, but with such a wavering heart, and
         indeed sometimes cold indifference, that I
         return without receiving much benefit to my
         soul. Do thou, Oh! Heavenly Father, look
         on me in mercy, forgive all past neglect,
         make me in every respect more like what
         a Christian ought to be, more humble, relying only on Thee for everything I need.  Subdue
         all earthly inclinations. Dear Saviour
         let me take my soul at the foot of thy cross,
         for ever having my eyes fixed on thy sacred
         body, bearing my sins' heavy load. Yes!
         then let me the chief of sinners, weep and
         love my life away! Indeed, O God, I must
         confess that I have rested too much on my
         own strength; Oh! forgive this presumption,
         and hear my prayer for the sake of thy dear
         Son, without whose atonement I dare not
         approach thy throne. Give me then that
         true faith, which puts all dependence on 
         the Creator and not on the creatures. Unto

         thee. let me look for every thing, for thy guidance and direction under all circumstances,
         in the situation in which thy good providence has placed me. Here I must confess,
         how short I fall of what I ought to be.
         How little of my time is engaged with the
         children under my care, in conversing of 
         thee and directing their young minds heavenward. Dear Lord forgive and teach me
         how to point thee out; let it be my delight 
         to talk of Thee; and oh! grant, that not one 
         may leave this house without some impression of thy dying love. Oh! that 
         my heart were more devoted to thy service
         I often think too much of the future. 
         On thee dear Saviour, I must defend
         Do with me what seemeth right to thee, and
         let my whole course be ordered by thy never 
         failing power. Thine I am, yes! thine
         eternally. Let me not by any misconduct,
         word, or action, ever bring a reproach upon
         thy followers. When thou seest I am going
         astray for thy mercy's sake, by any means;
         which Thou choosest, head me into the right 
         path, oh!

         Ah! suffer me not to be a stumbling-
         block to any person, but may it in my walk be
         seen, that I with thee have been. These petitions an unworthy sinner ventures to ask
         only through our Mediator and Advocate, Jesus
         Christ, who died for our transgressions and was
         bruised for our iniquities; and of this I feel
         assured: He loveth us unspeakably,
         Nor lets us pray in vain,
         But gives the fearful heart that hope
         Thy suit thou shalt obtain.
         The next extract which is dated September 6th
         lets us know, how soon and how kindly the
         Lord answered her petitions, giving her holy
         joy in believing. She writes: Jesus is my
         joy, therefore blest am I. Thy ever gracious
         Shepherd, how gently hast thou led me into
         thy fold. Thou hast drawn me with chords
         of love to Thee, and now thou knowest that my
         soul delighteth in Thee. I have had kind
         visits oft from Thee in the night season.
         Thou hast condescended to assist me in
         my duties in the day time. Yes! I have
         often felt thee. Oh dearest Saviour, continue
         to be near unto me, as the air which constantly I breath. Satan does sometimes try to draw
         me from thee by suggesting, that after all,

      <p>       
         perhaps there is no God. But thy long suffering and tender mercies are past expression.
         How often after such moments, hast Thou
         drawn me to thyself, so that the language
         of my heart has been - "I will a little pilgrim
         be - Resolved alone to follow Thee. Thou Lamb
         of God who now art gone- Up to thy everlasting
         throne"- etc. The following expressions of 
         thankfulness and humble confession, occur under 
         the same date: Oh! God! Thy goodness to me is
         past all expression; thy merciful hand has 
         been over me these many years. How often hast 
         thou raised me from a bed of sickness, yet how 
         have I returned thy kindness? I have after a time
         forgotten- and yet not quite. No thou hast often
         showed thy great compassions by leading me to 
         reflect on thy past mercies. Oh! how shall
         I, the most sinful, due thanksgiving raises-
         And sound my great deliverers praise! =
         November 28th, we have the following expressions of
         heart, clearly showing, that the bright hope of
         immortality, which shed such a glory round her 
         last few hours, was then already enkindled in 
         her soul. She writes: "The beloved of the Lord
         shall dwell in safety by him, and the Lord shall
         cover him all the day long"- Deut. 33.12.

      <p>
         Yes, dear Lord, thou dost indeed had me on
         in safety and mercy, and what have I deserved
         Nothing! - I am an unprofitable servant
         My transgressions are too numerous to count;
         but I know in whom I have believed, and
         he is able and willing to keep that which I
         have committed to him till that great day,
         when I shall gain permission to leave this
         mortal tent. Oh! my soul, thou hast had of
         late sweet converse with thy heavenly Friend;
         what and if he should call thee to live with Him.
         "Since He did from death arise,
         And then ascend victorious,
         I likewise in the hope rejoice,
         To raise again more glorious,
         Thus free from fear I can in peace
         Depart to see him as he is,
         And live with him forever!"
         She then adds: "This is Sunday morning,
         "And I am detained at home through a cold,
         "however, however I shall attend the last
         "meeting; and ever blessed Saviour, do thou
         "grant me thy blessing. If a life is read, Oh!
         "that some past may have a reference to my
         "case. Send thy Holy Spirit upon all; so that
         "he who reads and those who hear, may go home

         thankful that they were able to attend thy house."-
         In the early part of the year 1825, she appeared
         to have been filled with a more entire spirit of
         devotedness to the Lord, a more ardent desire for his
         service and for being instrumental towards the
         spread of His Kingdom. She had before this
         period engaged in the service of the Ladies School
         at Tytherton, as a teacher, but the following
         extracts appear to aim at a more direct and
         spiritual employment in the house of the
         Lord. March 2nd, 1825- She writes:
         "The world passeth away and the lust thereof;
         but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever"
         "Oh! my soul, think often of this text.
         "Help me Dear Saviour, to devote soul and body
         "unto thee. 'Tis all I have to offer thee,
         "Oh! Take me as thy property. Yes! I am more
         "and more convinced, the nearer I live to my
         "dear Saviour, the greater is my portion of happiness.
         "Oh! that all could be persuaded to turn from their
         "evil ways and live. And Oh! that everything I did,
         "had a reference to the furtherance of the Kingdom of
         "God. How much of my time is spent in needless
         "perplexity about the things of this world! Oh! that

      <p>            
         "expectation is from him"- "Oh! dearest Saviour
         "send down thy Holy Spirit upon me, and lead me on in
         "the path of righteousness. Condescend to direct my
         "thoughts, words, and actions. To thee let all my wishes

         "thy mercies? I am not worthy to pick up the crumbs
         "that fall from my Masters table, but thou feedest me
         "bountifully with choice things. I desire to resign every
         "inclination to thy will. Help me to do so; I can do
         "nothing of myself. This day if thou will accept
         "Oh! God, of such, I devote hand and heart to Thee, do
         "with me as Thou pleasesth,- I may do some
         "service, poor dust though I am!" The latter part
         of the same year appears to have been a time of trial.
         She writes, Sep 20th "I am a sinful creature O
         "Lord, have mercy upon me! Be thou my friend,
         "my counsellor and guide, yes, my All in All.
         "If I have thee, I have however, what me eternally

         "I deserved. Let me not give way to an unthank-

         "all the vain things which charmed me most,

           October 22nd. "Thy soul, now with assurance-

         that fear him, and His Righteousness unto
         childrens, to such as keep his commandment
         to do them." Thus beautifully end her
         notes of the year 1825, - In the Spring
         of the year 1826, it was proposed to her to
         remove to Gracehill to be employed as a teach-
         er in the Ladies Boarding School there.
         In a letter to her brother then Director of the
         Schools in that congregation- She thus
         signified her acceptance of the situation: With
         diversity of feelings. I this time address you, not
         that I am undetermined what step to take, on the
         contrary I am pleased you thought of me. I trust
         I shall be aided and supported by my unseen Friend,
         to discharge every duty committed to me, with
         credit and satisfaction; that I may not become
         an offence or stumbling stone to any person
         is my sincere prayer, but may my conduct be
         such as becomes a follower of Him, who was
         meek and lowly." She evidently sought
         the direction of the Lord in this step.

         and by her manuscript it appears the word of the Lord
         to Jacob was applied to her own case: "Behold I
         will be with thee, and will keep thee in all places
        whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into
         this land; for I will not leave thee, untill I
         have done that which I have spoken to thee
         of." ----
         Her feelings at leaving Tytherton, where she
         had enjoyed so much grace, she thus expresses in
         the letter above quoted: "I have now lived in Tytherton 6 years. In this place I have attained my
         church priviledges, and received much kindness
         from several of its inhabitants, therefore you
         will not wonder, that my feelings are somewhat various. I shall always retain sentiment 
         of gratitude and respect for many individuals."
         She arrived in Gracehill about the middle 
         of June; and spent 3 years and a half, faithfully
         and usefully employed in the sphere that
         was allotted her there. It was a season of
         sweet and gratefully remembered intercourse
         with her brother and sister, with whom she 
         spent, not unprofitably, great part of her 
         spare time, feeling their house to be her
         home, and giving and receiving that mutual
         encouragement, which we all feel necessary in our various avocations. A few of

         passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and
         through the floods, they shall not overflow thee,
         When thou walkest through the fire thou shall
         not be burned, neither shall the flames kindle
         upon thee." "This does ofttimes renew my courage, when it otherwise would sink. And to
         build upon this gracious promise, as a rock
         which ne'er can shrink, is what my poor
         heart doth pant for. Thus to trust unto my

         rejoiced in God my Saviour." Give me O my heavenly Father a more thankful heart; let me

         affliction, or visit me in trying dispensations
         give me grace to bow with humble resignation, and moreover rejoice, that thou dost so far
         notice me, as to treat me as a child. During
         the last year I have indeed been tried in various ways, so that in a measure I may say
         my foot had well nigh slipped; but thou art
         the searcher of hearts, and nothing is hidden

         and mercy directeth my way, may mercy me
         ever attend. Through years that may yet be
         to come; in every danger me befriend and peacefully guide me safe home. But if I have
         felt trials, I have been comforted, yea rich
         blessings have crowned my head, and with
         them my cup does o’erflow. When I look 
         around me, how ought I to blush for allowing a murmuring thought to find entrance
         in my breast. But I am a sinful worm
         O Lord, and can do nothing as I ought, 
         without thy enabling grace. Oh! my
         heavenly Father, send thy Holy Spirit
         unto me, make me more humble, let me
         have a constant feeling of thy presence, and
         let me take my seat at the foot of my Saviour's
         cross, and bear his example ever before me. 
         Perhaps this may be my last year, and if it 
         should not, still may I spend it as though
         it were. If any man serve me, him will
         my Father honour. I devote most heartily
         soul and body unto thee. And Oh! that

         employ the generality of men, whose interest

         is to prepare for a better city. What if things
         do not always answer our expectations, are we 
         on that account to despond? certainly not! For
         God in mercy sends afflictions to teach us this
         is not our home. If he were not to do so, we
         might grow hardened and secure in our sins,
         until they plunged us into endless woe! --
         Oh! that I could walk as though each day
         were to be my last. The crosses and vexations
         which occur here, are but for a short time,
         the joys and happiness of heaven are for a never
         ending eternity: why then should do I allow
         such things to affect me so much? This is 
         indeed sinful, but human nature is in
         itself unable to overcome the assails of its
         mighty opponents; the spirit may indeed be
         willing to do what is right, but the flesh
         is weak. But Oh! dearest Saviour, I would
         be wholly thine; take thou possession of my 
         heart, and whatever would obstruct any of thy
         blessed views with me, root it out, although it

         our dear departed relative, though in the full

         "Till my life shall end, do thou oh Lord, condescend
         to be my councellor and friend: On my heart let thy
         precepts be inscribed, and let thy great example be
         my constant endeavour to imitate; so that I may
         not, in any way, be a hindrance to any of the Lambs

         their spare time, especially on the Sabbath in singing with them such Hymns, or Sacred musical pieces
         as they themselves selected. this was done in an 
         easy, free, and agreeable manner; so that it pleased and 
         edified at the same time; and she had the happiness
         to know from one of the letters of her pupils, that 
         her endeavours thus profitably to impress the tender 
         mind with the duties and truths of religion, were not
         in vain.

      <p>June 3rd She writes probably in reference to her
         approaching birthday: "Surely goodness and mercy will
         follow me all the days of my life. O that I may but
         prove faithful to my high and heavenly calling. But oh!
         how slow in performing what I know to be right, and
         how prone to do that which is evil. 'Well might the
         Prophet exclaim, "the heart is deceitful above all
         things and desperately wicked." Search me O God, and 
         know my heart, try me and know each thought.
         But in thy judgement, remember mercy, and let the
         atoning blood of Jesus Christ plead and prevail in
         my behalf. I indeed long to be more closely
         united unto thee. O for more faith, love, hope and
         charity to take possession of my sinful, but I feel

         is wise and all powerful." -- Feb. 1, 1829

         power over the Angell and prevailed; he wept and made
         supplication unto him." God desires that we should
         look up to him for enabling grace under every difficulty and temptation. Through his grace alone can 
         we poor sinners overcome the snares of our great
         adversary. The Christian has many assurances,
         that whatever is permitted is intended for his good;
         according to his day so shall his strength be, if he 
         but bow with holy resignation to the dispensation,
         of his Almighty Father. "Be glad in the Lord
         and rejoice then, the righteous and shout for joy all
          that are upright in heart." What can be a
         more suitable employment for the Christian, than
         to rejoice in the Lord? who has cause to rejoice if he have 
         not? -- Oh! that all could be persuaded to turn

         Calm O Lord every storm that would arise in 
         my breast, -- bring down every high imagination, and let me be determined to follow thee and thee
         only, cost what it may. Thou art indeed my

         appointed. Save us O God of our Salvation, and
         gather us together, that we may give thanks unto
         thy holy name , and glory in thy praise!"--
         From the last clause of this prayer, and the
         peculiar expression, "gather us together," it would
         appear that her affectionate mind was thus
         embracing in its desires before God, all the members of her family. May her fervent petitions be
         most graciously answered.  The last meditation
         she has left is dated June 16th 1829, and it
         clearly shows how the Lord was preparing 
         her mind for that important change in life,
         which took place with her before the end of the 
         year. She writes, -- "To thee O heavenly 
         Father, I desire to submit all my desires, and
         to thee would I commit all my concerns, cast all
         my cares upon thee, conscious that thou carest
         for me. And who so fit to choose my lot, or
         regulate my ways, as a being, who loved me 
         so as not to spare his own Son, who knows
         what is best for me, and is able to make all things 
         work together for my good? I have often been 
         brought low, but thou hast helped me, and 
         when I have been looking for nothing but
         darkness, at evening time it has been light.
         But oh! after all thy patience, goodness, and 
         care, how often do I betray my depravity by
         seeming to mistrust Thee. Yet I could cry

         one in all places and circumstances. However
         ignorant of the future, enable me to trust in 
         Thee and not be afraid. I should begin, even in 
         this vale of tears, the song I hope forever to sing. 
         "Marvelous are thy works, just and true are all
         thy ways, O thou King of Saints! Enable me
         to confide in thy promises, and rely on thy
         constant protection and care. Let thy law be
         dear unto me. May I be devoted to thy service 
         and find it perfect freedom. Thou dost not indeed
         stand in need of any, but since thou art pleased
         in infinite wisdom and condescension, to safe
         means, I would say Lord what would thou 
         have me to do? here is my hand, me, Lord
         assist, to serve thee midst reproach and 
         shame. Be it my one undivided aim to glorify Him who has done so much to render 
         me, happy and acceptable to God!” She then 
         proceeds to dilate on the love of God to man
         as exhibited, not only in redemption, but

         but also in the works of nature, which
         eloquently declare God's glory and speak 
         His praise. This was a favourite consideration with her. She admired the beau-
         ties and sublimities of creation with that 
         calm satisfaction, yet holy delight which
         only those do feel, who can exclaim as 
         they behold these are all the production
         of Him I call my who is my dear Heavenly Father, with whom I am at peace, 
         through the blood of the Lamb!' --
         She concludes thus: "And should man
         be mute, after receiving so many benefits?
         Undoubtedly not. He should lead the chorus.
         Each breath should sound forth the praises
         of so blessed and adorable a friend. May thy
         continued goodness make a lasting impression
         on my _ and heart. Thou fountain of all 
         goodness, draw me to thy self, and enable me to do
         my duty, be it what it may." -- Soon after this 
         in the month of November, she reserved a proposal of marriage from Brother James 
         Latrobe, who had been called to the service of the 
         Congregation at Ayr. This proposal she 
         accepted, after requesting the consent of

         December, and arrived at their post the last day
         of the year . From the moment of her arrival at Ayr, she entered upon her work 
         with zeal and earnestness, and yet under a deep 
         sense of her unworthiness to be employed 
         as a handmaid of the Lord. By her Christian cheerfulness and lively confidence in
         God, and implicit trust in his kind leadings, she was a help to husband in
         his official duties, especially when those 
         duties led over thorny paths: her love of
         spiritual converse and family devotion too,
         and her interest in the welfare of the Congregation, were calculated to increase that love
         to the Saviour and his people which not only 
         sweetens the cup of life, but is essential to 
         the usefulness of the Lords servants. She
         loved to see and welcome those Brethren and Sisters
         and friends, who called from time to time, to 
         be refreshed and animated in their christian 
         course. All were received with affability. 
         And to some. especially of the aged sisters

         her conversation proved to be a blessing and a comfort.
         Although no longer engaged in the education
         of children, yet that love to the lambs of the
         flock, which characterises many of her private meditations, was undiminished. 
         Remembering the blessings she had experienced when taken in early life, by her parents
         to the children's meetings at Bristol, and
         also the impression, which the remarks and 
         advice of her beloved father had made upon
         her youthful mind, she felt a strong intterest in behalf of the children of this
         congregation, and impelled by that interest, 
         she accompanied her husband to the houses of all the parents, previous to the children's 
         Festival, although by no means well at the 
         time. The weighty and affectionate words and 
         expostulations she employed on that occasion 
         as a consequence of that visit, was, the 
         recommencement of meetings for the children of the Congregation which had been for
         some time discontinued. She was peculiarly interested in the son of our Brethren and Sister
         Borland, who departed happily to the Lord in 
         August this year, after a severe mental struggle

         struggle, and she often mingled her tears with those 
         of her husband, while he was engaged in visiting the boy on his sickbed. Sabbaths were
         days of special delight to her; she loved the 
         assembly of the Lords people, whither public 
         or private, often prolonging the subjects that 
         had been treated of in private conversation,
         and expressing her gratitude for the abundant 
         provision of Gods house. Even when indisposed in body, and gently urged to stay at home, 
         she often said, in allusion to her approaching confinement. No I will go to the Lord's house 
         while I can you know I shall soon be deprived
         of that privilege for a considerable time."
         The event, which she thus alluded to, naturally led her to frequent meditation and converse,
         on the possibility of its terminating in her 
         dissolution, and some months ago, she expressed her conviction, that if the Lord should
         see fit to make it the occasion of her change
         coming, all would be well; she could meet 
         her Saviour with joy as a pardoned sinner,
         who had nothing to boast, but whose trust was
         in his atonement and righteousness. Such an 
         Expression

          of her sentiment was especially elicited
         by the sudden departure and burial of Sister Morton
         when walking with her husband in the peaceful spot, where her own dear remains were interred but 3 weeks after, in hope of a joyful
         resurrection. The kindness and cordiality manifested towards her and her husband, both by our 
         own Brethren and Sisters and by many excellent friends,
         was gratefully felt by her. On this subject and 
         on the general state of her mind, she thus 
         wrote to her sister in Gracehill, in the latter
         part of June: "I might charge myself with

         varying condition, display the principles and disposition
         of one, who is seeking for glory and honour and immortality. I would not wish to be at any our disposal,
         but rejoice to think I am under the care of one,
         who is too wise to err, and too kind to injure"
         As the time of her confinement approached,
         she stayed her mind calmly on the Lord, neither
         giving way to needless fears, nor yet elated with 
         too sanguine hopes. She found the letter and 
         advice of her dear father a great help to her,
         truly valuing the privilege of having relatives,
         who were bound to her by the double ties of 
         nature and of grace. Thus prepared in her 
         mind, the time of her trial came, and after a 
         long, difficult, and painful labour of 4 days,
         she was enabled to become the mother of a fine, 
         healthy boy, early on the morning of Friday
         15th Oct. During this severe trivial
         She manifested that patience which had so long
         characterized her, and was really an edification
         to those who were around her. She constantly
         noticed the text of the day, drawing much com-
         fort and support from them. This was especially

         the case on Wednesday, when she
         took occasion from the daily word: "The Lord
         hath called me from the womb?” to speak to
         Sr Borland, to whom she was deservedly attached, of the Lord's kindness to her from her ear-
         first infancy, in caring for her, hedging up her
         way, keeping her from temptation, and guiding her
         gently by the streams of salvation, and in the 
         green pastures of his love. She spoke also 
         of the happiness and profit she had derived,
         from her connection with the Brethren’s Church,
         Indeed she sincerely loved this part of the 
         Lord's vineyard, as is plain from her manuscript
         which contains meditations on some memorial
         days of our church, and petitions on behalf of 
         some of its members. She passed the Friday 
         very favourably, and though she did not sleep much
         during the night, her medical attendant expressed this satisfaction at her state on saturday
         morning, and declared he did not expect to find her
         so well. About the middle of the day, however,
         unfavorable symptoms appeared, which did
         not yield to the remedies applied, and when her
         physician came again in the morning evening, he recognized the marks of rapid and decided
         inflammation. Powerful means were used to

         impede its progress and anxiously was the effect awaited; 
         yet still the symptoms increased. She often reproved the
         anxiety of those around her, and scarcely repressed her
         tears, bidding them not to cast away their confidence. After a lapse of two hours, still stronger
         means were resorted to, as a final hope, and her
         husband proposing that they should unite in
         beseeching the blessing of the Lord for her
         restoration, she expressed her desire that this
         should be alone; begging him at the same time
         not to weep, for she was in the Lord's hands,
         He had often raised her up for when brought low,
         and could do it again if He pleased. All were
         now composed after prayer, and the dear sufferer
         being asked if she were resigned to the Lord's will,
         whatever it might be, replied cheerfully, "Yes I am."
         Shortly after, she added with great emphasis:
         "Oh! what proud hearts we have; this is
         sent to humble one, and if I am brought through;
         I shall walk more humbly with my God." 
         Observing the tears of those about her, she
         endeavoured to comfort them, told them not to
         weep for her sake for it disturbed her composure

         and proceeded to say: "I had once to seek my Saviour,
         when in this state, but not now. I know he 
         will do all things well!" During the night
         some of the symptoms abated, though the most
         alarming continued. She became very heavy,
         slept, and wandered occasionally in her mind, yes
         always in an edifying way. Early in the morn
         ing her medical attendant came, felt her
         pulse, shook her head, and upon having her 
         loom, informed her husband, that all hope of
         her life was now gone, mortification had
         commenced, and that day would be her last. 
         With a bleeding and agonised heart, yet with 
         prayer for the Divine support, he immediately returned to the bedside of his dying wife,
         to hear, what I may have to tell you?' Though 
         she had appeared almost insensible before, she
         seemed to understand him in a moment, looked 
         astonished, and then with the utmost composure
         and firmness said: "Yes my dear I am! Having been
         informed of the Doctor's opinions respecting her,
         she exclaimed with peace in her countenance;
         Well - the Lord's will be done the Lord's will is
         always best. I had hoped to have been spared a little

         little longer, but I am resigned to my Saviour's will."
         a pause insued, a period of sobs and tears, "Don't cry for
         me" she said, "I am happy going to our Saviour",
         Turning to her husband, she said: "The Lord will support you and bless you, and be far more to you than I have
         been. We have been very happy together, but now you
         must give me up to the Lord. Don't weep." and then
         she looked up with glory in her countenance, and 
         exclaimed; "O the delights, the heavenly joys,
         The glories of the place - Where Jesus sheds the
         brightest beams Of his o'erflowing grace."
         and who would not go there" Every thing like
         wandering or insensibility had now completely left 
         her. She seemed to realize, in the body, the joys
         that were before her, and her bedside became the very
         gate of heaven. It was as though the place were
         surrounded by happy spirits and holy angels, waiting
         to receive her redeemed soul, when it should be unclothed. Her husband being called out for a moment, she
         took that opportunity to say to Sister Borland;" Ask Brother
         Kleinsmith to write to Brother Ramftler and like my
         dear Father, that I am departing in hope of a 
         joyful resurrection, and am going to be committed to my
         dear Mother." and then she added, with her eyes

         uplifted to heaven, and oh! for angels to waft me to
         that happy place!" feeling then for her dear husband, she
         said to Sister Borland, who was weeping "Don't cry before
         him, it grieves him." Being asked upon her husbands return, if she would see a young friend, who
         was waiting to speak to her, she replied: "Oh! yes
         send for her, let her come while I can speak." As soon
         as she had come to the bedside, the dying patient grasped her hand and said: "O my dear, you must come out
         of the world and leave its vanities and attend to the salvation of your soul. I know it is hard to leave the
         world, but you must do it, if you would have hope in
         your death, when you are like me." She said more
         to the same purpose, and directed her to the Lord Jesus,
         and when the young lady promised to be kind to her
         baby. she said Oh! I have given up my soul
         it will be well cared for, but, (and she put dying emphases into the words) oh! do care for your own
         salvation." Another lady of decided Christian 
         character approaching, she helped her, and said: "The
         steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the
         work of the Lord" Frequently did she say to sister 
         Borland, who had been day and night at her bedside:
         "Oh! you have been very, very kind to me - the Lord will 
         reward you persevere, persevere and the Lord bless

         you and your family."---- knowing herself once from meditation, she asked what day it was, &amp; being bold it was 
         the sabbath day, she explained with amimation: "Oh!
         it is a blessed thing to die on the sabbath, and so enter
         into an eternal sabbath."----   Shortly after it was 
         proposed to sing with her; she said: oh! you! do"----
         and being asked to choose a verse, she gave out:
         "O then the sole defence and aid and but owing to the
         indistinctness of her voice only a few words were gathered and being it could not be found at the time. The following was then selected: Jesus at my dissolution and     
         when she said, "yes that will do." It was then hardly
         sang and partly sang out, but she maintained a heavenly composure, and often begged those around her 
         not to weep for her, for she was happy. Once or twice 
         she said, "perhaps the Doctor is mistaken. I am 
         too strong to die, I do not feel as if I were dying."
         But about two hours and a half before her departure 
         she said placidly: "Now I feel a change, it will not
         be long now."      And then she betook herself again to
         comfort those around her, &amp; especially her sorrowing
         partner. To him she said, with tender affection:
         "the lord will support you &amp; supply all your wants,
         I know he will, for I have prayed for you"---  He replies
         "yes my dear I know he will, but it is hard to part
         with you so soon."----"O! yes,"she answered, it is hard

         "but it will not be long-- soon we shall be united 
         again, never, never, to be parted.  you must finish 
         your work; &amp; then you will come after me, &amp; we shall 
         be united forever. I know you will care for our dear
         child, I am quite easy about it."__ At this time the 
          Doctor who was greatly interested about her, entered
         the room, when she eagerly addressed him: "How 
         long shall I live Doctor? He seemed much affected,
         &amp; replied: "My dear Mrs. Lattrobe, I am sorry to say 
         you cannot be long."   "Sorry! she said, sorry--- do not 
         say sorry. I am glad. Will it be two hours?" He 
         answered that it could not be much longer, &amp; that 
         he was happy to see her so resigned: when she
         explained: "Let me die the death of the righteous, &amp; let my last end be like his!” Her moments were now spent in sacred prayer, &amp; in comforting the survivors, but in a short time the 
         struggle of death became hard, though they
         were not severe, &amp; she said "it is a hard work to
         die"---&amp; several times, asked, "will it be long?"
         she was told it probably would not, but that the 
         Lord would give her strength equal to her day.
         This seemed to satisfy her, for on being asked, 
         whether a prayer should be made for her release 
         she said: "No! no! the Lords time is best, I can 
         wait patiently for that"--- 'Yes' said she- though
         I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

         I fear no evil, his rod &amp; his staff comfort me:"-- and 
         then with great earnestness, &amp; peace in her looks, she
         repeated the verse: "Now I have found the ground 
         where in-- Sure my souls anchor may remain;--
         Even Christ, who to atone for sin,---Was as a
         spotless victim slain, Whose mercy shall un-

         She now signified, that she wished to take leave of
         the friends saying,, "Goodbye--- Farewell to you all,"---
         waving her hands, &amp; repeating the words, when
         some seemed to linger. Being then left alone, with
         her husband &amp; sister Borland, she held their 
         hand most affectionately, &amp; comforted their hearts 
         saying to sister Borland, "you will be you to him: I

         He was deeply affected, and with much emotion, pronounced over her the blessing of the Lord for her 
         misfortune. at the close of it she said: amen! amen

         once more to gather a little strength, again expressed her gratitude to Sister  Borland, adding "you
         will be good to my child"---- &amp; again attempted to
         comfort her weeping partner. Every moment her
         eyes grew brighter, &amp; her counter once more 
         heavenly, &amp; she often said, " I think it will soon 
         be over, the conflict will soon be over ended-- Amen,
         Amen!" and as often did she turn to her weeping 
         husband, &amp; drew him towards her, to take leave of 
         her. Presently however, she requested tea to be 
         made &amp; turning to her partner, she said: "My dear, we will have a cup of tea together once  more."___

         that she was near her end, she then said: "the 
         conflict is nearly over--- bring the baby!" ---- bring 
         the baby!"---   The dear little infant was brought in
         and all unconscious of the coming loss, presented 
         to her dying mother. She kissed it eagerly, and 
         gently ribbled its little arm with hand, as
         it lay across its breast, doubtlessly imploring for 
         it, in silent fervour, the everlasting mercies
         of her Saviour. After the baby was removed,
         she had some sharp struggles: but about a
