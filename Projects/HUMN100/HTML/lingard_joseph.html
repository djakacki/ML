         the 29th of March was a blessed Lovefeast after the
         Burying of Brother Joseph Lingard, for
         the whole Society. He was born in 1680. in the Parish 
         of Glossop in the County of Derby . He was brought 
         in the high Church of Engelland . In 1729 he marryed
         the present Widdow, and had with her one son and 
         Daughter (which last lived here in the Choir-House)

         In the great Awakening which happened here round
         about in the Year 1743. our Brethren and his Wife became
         concerned to about their happiness. Ao 44 was he
         first aquainted with the Brethren and as the same year
         our Brethren Okerthaussen was put in prison for our Saviors.
         Sake, he and some Brethren more had the Happiness
         to partake on his reproach of scorn for the Gospel of 
         Christ. The preachings were kept in his House; but
         as his Son came of Age he became the Cause, that
         it must be left. Our Brother was of very few words,
         not talkative at all; however he loved the Brethren
         with whom he was assembled so well and dearly, that he
         very seldom stayed at home, notwithstanding
         he had above three Miles to walk; and in his last
         sickness he expressed himself still about? as little 
         he sometimes understood, what he said or sung, for
         all that he was a praying to our Savior that he would
         let him partake on their blessing and this was richly
         bestowed on him. He once met Brother Bohler on the Road
         to Brassington, and brought him the first time about 
         this Place, whereover, he rejoiced still in this last
         Days. He visited the Congregation in Fulneck several
         times and felt a call in his Heart to seek his abode
         in this Congregation. But this was not sooner
         performed while he was persuaded by his son, to 
         give over to him his whole estate, however as soon 
         as he consented, the son pulled down his dwelling home
         that he was forced as it were to seek his shelter at Dukenfield.

      <p>Dukenfield. Whereover he shortly before his End, declared
         himself towards his son. I lived above 80 years in this
         world, and have done nothing better, as my going to
         Dukenfield; and you never have done anymore good
         for me: then to pull down my Dwellings. 
         He came hither as a stranger, with his wife and daughter
         with a stick in his hand, without knowing where to
         find a place of his abode; but a brother took him so
         long in his house, till we could provide a lodging
         for him. He now was very glad to find for himself under
         the People of God. To be received into the Blessings of
         the Congregation he must stay very long, however 1759.
         he was with his wife and daughter received into the Congregation
         and 1760 was admitted to our dear Lords Supper. Which
         he took for his highest treasure in this world. His bodily
         Constitution was very strong, but since 2 years his strength
         decreased very remarkable and he begun to pine for
         his eternal Rest. In his last sickness, he was very 
         certain that his Desire would be soon fulfilled. 
         His Patience contented Contemplations has been every
         Body who saw him to admiration. Every Body 
         liked to be with him and therefore rather thronged them
         selves which Brother was to watch him. The Happyness
         of his Heart spread itself from it so that every Stranger
         could perceive what our Saviour has done on this old
         Vater. After he had blessed his Wife and Daughter and recommended 
         Them

         expired sweet of early the 26th of March
         in the 83 year of his age.
