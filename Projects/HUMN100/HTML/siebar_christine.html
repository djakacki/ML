      <p> The Girl Christine Sieber. She was born at Gnadenfrei the 10th of Sept. 1757. After her Valient Departure of this Life, she came with her Mother as a little
         child into the Widows House, where every Body loved her. In her tenderest years she
         had a Feeling of our Saviour in her Heart, and in the Day Time She was educated with
         the Children
         in the Anstalt. Ano 50 the 18th October She received quite in the Children Anstalt, where She in Comunion with other Children
         kept many a Liturgie to our Saviour. Ano 58 She was
         received into the Children Congregation. Allway it was a great Blessing to her, when She in comunion with the Children was
         allowed ot prostrate her self to our Saviour. Her poor Body
         was so weakly that at last all her limbs grow lame. Therefore she must be carryed
         everywhere. This caus'd her many a Smart &amp; some tinier impatience that She must loose
         so many
         fine Meetings. But when She thought on our Saviour and is Smart, then She was in her
         Heart ashamed &amp; of all Heart contented. She wept many Tears &amp; very often confessed:
         I am
         a poor &amp; miserable Child, &amp; for all that our ​​​​​​​dear

      <p> dear Saviour loveth me, as is very often on my Place so near to me, that I am not
         able to describe it. I am willing from all my Heart to renounce every Thing in his
         Way, to make me
         soon to his Pleasure. the 3th April She was still with her Children very amusing.
         The 4th She complained about great Pain on her Breast, &amp; declared directly that she
         is to go
         home, for that reason She took by her Sisters who attended &amp; thanked them two times
         for their Care &amp; trouble whith She made &amp; promised to think on them by our dear
         Saviour. After that She toock Leave in a very tender maner by her Mother &amp; desireth
         she would sing Verses, as among the rest these: Ich riech mich auf den Sabbat ang.
         Mein
         Seelgen wird such bald einmal aus feinen Hüttchen schwingen. Her Children continued
         with a sweet Litgurgie around her Bed. After that her tender Desire by our Saviour
         was to call her
         soon home. And said very often: Lovely Lamb, pray come soon! Asoon and in the Evening
         at 11 a clock she went happy home in our Heaven. Wound in her 12 Years of Age
