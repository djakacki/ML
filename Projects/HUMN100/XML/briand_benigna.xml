                  Here followed the <date when-iso="03-22">22nd of March</date> our
                  dear <persName>Sister Benigna Briand</persName>.
                  She was born the <date when-iso="1707-12-17">17th of December 1707</date> at <placeName>Lyneham</placeName> in 
                  <placeName>Wiltshire</placeName>. Her Parents have been of the <orgName>Quaker Religion</orgName>
                  &amp; She was brought up in the same Principles.
                  <date when-iso="1740-02-19">Anno 1740 the 19th  february</date> was She marryed to our <persName>Br.
                  Briand</persName> &amp; they followed a religious Life according to 
                  her Principles, But as <persName>Br. Cennick</persName> in this bounty his
                  Preachings begun, She &amp; her <persName ana="Br. Briand">Husband</persName> went to hear him
                  but Both got such an Impression at first that they offered
                 <persName>Br. Cennick</persName> their house for for a Preaching Place, that was
                  not all but they offered every Body who came to hear <persName ana="Br. Cennick">him</persName>
                  to harbour free. They bought at last a House &amp; provided
                  a Silence to preach therein.This occonomie (economy)continued 
                  many years, without finding hereby any Rest for their
                  own Heart. <persName>Br. Cennick</persName> was perfected all round the 
                  Country, &amp; by that means our <persName ana="Benigna Briand">Sister</persName> often herself
                  in Danger of her Life. To the same Time it happened 
                  that a certain Man was so <name type="emotion">enraged</name> about <persName>Br. Lennicks</persName>
                  Preachings from the Blood of Christ, that he made a
                  Plot with several wicked People that they would, <persName>Br. Cennick</persName> as his 
                  Auditory guide overstream with Blood of Oxen.
                  But this Man on a Sudden became <name type="emotion">mad</name> &amp; <name type="health">clear Blood
                  ran out of his nose &amp; Mouth</name> &amp; this continued several 
                  weeks under extraordinary <name type="emotion">Pain</name>, his terrible &amp; <name type="emotion">furious</name> 
                  Sooth made, that nobody would venture to come near 
                  him,
                  <pb/>///<lb/>
                  till he at last with <name type="emotion">Howling &amp; bawling</name> went to Eternity.
                  All his Companions found in some Way or other by &amp; by a
                  comendable End. In this restless Time, <persName>Br.Briand</persName> 
                  accompanyed <persName>Br. Cennick</persName> to <placeName>London</placeName> &amp; there lernt (learned)by 
                  that Opportunity to know the Brethren he was so over-
                  taken by the Grace of <persName>Christ</persName> among them, that he on 
                  his Retour testifyed it to his dear <persName ana="Benigna Briand">Wife</persName> to a great Im-
                  pression of her Heart. She directly begg'd him that he
                  would invite the Brethren to <placeName>Wiltshire</placeName>, which done 
                  according to the <name type="emotion">general Desire</name> of the awakened Souls 
                  in this Parts. <persName>Br. Schlicht</persName> was the first after <persName>Br. Cennick</persName>
                  who was sent thiter (thither), his Testamony of Christ found Applause 
                  &amp; our <persName ana="Benigna Briand">Sister</persName> declared herself: for this Preachings of the 
                  Sake of our <persName>Saviour</persName> I venture my All. Now begun  
                  her Period wherein our <persName>Saviour</persName> begun to draw nearer 
                  to her Heart, her natural Fire begun by Degrees to 
                  dye &amp; <persName>the holy Ghost</persName> brought her in his School to a 
                  more childlike &amp; yielding Temper. As our <persName>Mr. Johanes</persName> 
                  <date when-iso="1748-05-09">1748 the 9 of May</date> in <placeName>Buttermere</placeName> the Congregation 
                  errected she was baptiseth by him in the Death of 
                 <persName> Christ</persName> by the Name <persName>Benigna</persName> &amp; that was her Name 
                  by right &amp; <date when-iso="09-22">the 22nd of September a.c.</date> She was admitted to 
                  the holy Sacrament to a real &amp; remaining Blessing for her Heart.
                  She lived 7 Miles distant of us, but surely came every
                  Sunday to our Preaching &amp; that 6 years, till she removed
                  with her <persName ana="Br. Briand">Husband</persName> to <placeName>Bath</placeName>. Here she entertained the Brethren 
                  as formerly which just now begun to visit and preach
                  in
               </p>

               <p>
                  in this Parts, with all imaginable <name type="emotion">Tenderness</name> &amp; wish'd
                  nothing more as that the Brethren would settle in this 
                  <placeName ana="Bath">Place</placeName>. In the meantime She &amp; <persName ana="Br. Briand">her Husband</persName> visited diligently
                  at <placeName>Bristol</placeName> till <date when-iso="1757">1757</date>. a <orgName>Society</orgName> was errected at <placeName>Bath</placeName>.
                  Her House was the Residence of our Labourer &amp; She
                  made it her Pleasure to serve <persName ana="Brethren">them</persName>. <persName>Our Saviour</persName> 
                  blessed her marrigage with 6 children, whereof 4 is 
                  ready by <persName>our Lord</persName> &amp; the rest is in the Care of the 
                  Congregation. Our blessed <persName ana="Benigna Briand">Sister</persName> had extra ordinary
                  Gifts of <persName>our Saviour</persName>. Her skillfull &amp; understanding 
                  Behaviour, &amp; the Maintainance of so many, of her poor 
                  Nighbours, which She with a willing Heart took upon
                  her, caused that every Body <name type="emotion">loved &amp;respected</name> her.
                  Her Heart hung on our <persName>Saviours</persName>, &amp; his Death &amp; <name type="emotion">Suffering</name>,
                  was the most <name type="emotion">delightfull</name> object of her Soul.
                  By the last visit of <persName>Mr. &amp; Sister Nilshman</persName> on this Place
                  She came among the Hourly Intercessors, which was
                  a real Blessing to her &amp; She came never from her 
                  Conversation Hour with <persName>our Saviour</persName> without <name type="emotion">Tears
                  in her Eyes.</name> I was with <name type="emotion">Plesure</name> to behold how She 
                  from Day so became more <name type="emotion">tender &amp; intimate</name> with her  
                  only Friend &amp; bloody <persName>Breidegroom of her Soul</persName>! Scarcely 
                  could a Body him name to her, then her <name type="emotion">Tears of
                  Love</name> begun to flow. As She in <date when-iso="06">June</date> was in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
                  She said: "Now I come not more hither, till I am to
                  be buryed here." <date when-iso="06-13">the 13th</date> She enjoyd our <name type="event">Lords Supper</name>
                  the last time, &amp; not long after She was forced to lay down
                  &amp; as 
                  <pb/>///<lb/>
                  it could be guessd; that She would get the <name type="health">Smal Pox</name>.
                  One of her Daughters did all She could to hinder that her 
                  Dear Mother should not be perplept about it; to which 
                  She said: "My dear Child, why should I be <name type="emotion">afraid</name> thereof,
                  <persName>Our Saviour</persName> must take one Say or another to promote my
                  Departing from this dying Body, if it is by this Way
                  <persName>his</persName> holy Will, that's all one to me." May <persName>he</persName> only give
                  me <name type="emotion">Patience</name>, then my most <name type="emotion">happy</name> Lot is to be with
                  him. <date when-iso="03-16">the 16th of March</date>, the <name type="health">Smal-Pox</name> became visible,
                  She defyneth her Husband to absent himelf because
                  he had not to, &amp; declard to him that she was quite
                  resignd into the <placeName>Hill of our Saviour</placeName>. The following 
                  Day came her Daughter from <placeName>Bristol</placeName> to see her, to 
                  which she related the blessed Situation her was in.
                 <date> The 21st</date> as <persName>Mr. Miller</persName> asked her: if She intented
                  to go home. She replied: yes, that I will, if it is 
                  the <name type="emotion">Pleasure</name> of my <persName>Saviour</persName> to fetch me. There is no
                  Misunderstanding between me &amp; <persName ana="Saviour">him</persName>. Her <name type="emotion">Pain</name>
                  She endured with astonishing <name type="emotion">Patience</name> &amp; said:
                  What's that little Skinmark in Proportion to what our 
                  <persName>Saviour</persName> endured for my Sake. The Night following
                  a great Alteration happened by her. Her Daughter
                  inquired: Mommy will you really go home? "Yes replied 
                  She." but I must first see some Br. &amp; Sisters."
                  She then went for <persName ana="Br. Cennick">Br.</persName> &amp; <persName>Mr. Miller</persName> but as they came
                  she found her Preachless allready. They kept her a 
                  pretty Liturge &amp; under these Words: Der konig 
                  wende fich yu dir, und deine narde riech &amp; flew

                  her happy Soul into the Bosom of her <persName>bloody Bride

                  who had in his Sleep an Instinct of her
                  Departure, said as he awaked to the People in the House:
                  My <persName ana="Benigna Briand">Wife</persName> is gone, fell down on his Face &amp; thanked our 
                  dear <persName>Saviour</persName> for all the Blessings bestowed on her. Soon
                  after that, <persName>Mr. Miller</persName> came before his Door &amp; sung: Ihi
                  Mund ist mun erblasset in Jesu Arm is School, as
