                  <persName>John Willey</persName>, a Servant of the
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName> in the Brn's Church, who departed
                  this lifse in <placeName>Gracehill</placeName>, <date>October
                     6th 1847</date>. Aged 66 years. Written by his children Not
                  having been able to find any account of our dear father's
                  life, written by himself, we can merely record some of the
                  principal outward outward changes which he met with here,
                  adding, the few remarks on himself and his experience, which
                  have recurred to us in the <name type="object">private
                     diaries</name> of his congregation and in his
                  cor(r)espondence. He was born <date>Dec. 13th 1781</date> in
                  <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>; his father,
                  <persName>Michael Willey</persName> (born <date>1729</date>
                  died aged 86, having served the the Congregation 66 years" was
                  at that time laborer of the Congregation at
                  <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>. He had one sister being and
                  one brother, <persName>Joseph</persName>, both older
                  ​​​​​​​than </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="2">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-02">2 </head>
               <p> than himself; of whom his brother was many years an active
                  minister of several congregations, and was called home before
                  him to his eternal rest, <date>Aug. 11th 1841</date>. A strong
                  <name type="emotion">affection</name> existed between the
                  brothers, and some of our dear father's <name type="emotion">happiest</name> seasons were the visits which he was
                  occasionally though rarely able to pay to his brother and
                  family. His early life, though chequered by the <name type="health"
                     >death</name> of an affectionate mother, when
                  he was only 6 years of age, appears to have passed very
                  pleasantly among the youth in <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>.
                  His old teacher <persName>B. Bradley</persName>, kept an
                  unfailing place in his memory, and he spoke much and with
                  great kindness of his well-remembered <name type="emotion">care</name> and <name type="emotion"
                     >love</name>. As a
                  sign of the comparative innocences of those early years, he
                  would mention the fact that he had never heard an oath
                  ​​​​​​​until he had attained the age of 12 years </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="3">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-03">3 </head>
               <p> years. From some narratives of that time which he would
                  occasionally call to mind, it seems as tho' his habitual <name type="emotion">good temper</name> had early displayed
                  itself, and rendered him a favorite amongst his teachers and
                  companions. At the age of 14, he went, as was there customary,
                  to learn a trade in <placeName>Bedford</placeName>, where he
                  experienced great kindness from <persName>Br.
                     Livius</persName>, of whom he long retained a grateful
                  recollection. Here of course, he was somewhat more of the
                  world and of its ways of sinful pleasure, and appears to have
                  <name
                     type="emotion">lamented</name> the want of Godliness
                  amongst many of the young people with whom he was associated.
                  It was particularly whilst on a visit in
                  <placeName>London</placeName>, on his way to
                  <placeName>Kingswood</placeName> that he was struck with
                  the deep depravity of human nature, and found <name type="emotion">gratitude</name> to that
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName>, to whom he had been early led,
                  and who had so mercifully held his preserving hand </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="4">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-04">4 </head>
               <p> hand over him. At the same time, we doubt not, he obtained
                  deeper views of his own sinfulness, and of his need of the
                  salvation wrought for sinners, though the meritorious life and
                  death of our <roleName>Lord and Savior</roleName>
                  <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>. In <date>1802</date>, when
                  21 years of age, he went to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>;
                  and on his father's being appointed laborer of
                  <placeName>Kingwood congregation</placeName> about that
                  time, he was frequently with him there assisting in the school
                  in that place. It was here he was viewed with the
                  Congregation, and shortly after, in <date>1804</date>, very
                  permitted to partake for the first time of the <name type="event">Holy Communion</name> There events seem to
                  have made a way deep impression upon his mind, if we may judge
                  from a remarkable experience which he has recorded as having
                  happened in him on the morning of <name type="event">Palm
                     sunday</name>
                  <date>1804</date>. If it came upon me sleeping, he </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="5">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-05">5 </head>
               <p> he writes, it made the same impression as though I had been
                  awake. There came over me a great <name type="emotion">fear</name> and trem- bling violent sweat, and a <name type="emotion">dread</name> of being destroyed instantly. I
                  lifted up my hand and raised my eyes, but could not rise, for
                  the clothes were as a rock around me. There stood one whose
                  eyes were fixed on me, with a shining light; before him an
                  upright pillar, with which I expected to be slain, for the
                  sense of my <name type="emotion">guilt</name> increased my
                  <name type="emotion"
                     >fear</name>. I never can forget his
                  look. He spoke - O how long have I delayed my coming; how long
                  have I observed thy ways; I have had patience with thee; thou
                  hast had advantages but thou hast neglected them; thy crimes
                  are very great, thou hast been preserved through <name type="emotion">mercy</name> hither to, but now ______ Here
                  I prayed <name type="emotion">earnestly</name> for mercy, that
                  I might not Be destroyed in my sins; yet my heart was hard as
                  the rock. I was powerfully convinced that it was
                  <persName>Jesus</persName> who ​​​​​​​stood before me, and
                  continued praying till </p>

            <div type="page" n="6">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-06">6 </head>
               <p> Till at last he mercifully Caused floods of tears to flow
                  from mine eyes. Where I still in treated him to have mercy on
                  me a wretched and <name type="emotion">guilty</name> sinner,
                  his countenance changed, he seemed filled with <name type="emotion">compassion</name>, looked on me with pity,
                  and spoke to me kindly, so that I was convinced I was heard.
                  His last words were very impressive. "Be in earnest for your
                  soul's salvation lest I come quickly with a woe." Where he
                  vanished, the pillar that that seemed ready to destroy me,
                  appeared changed into a hom(e) of salvation. I awoke to my
                  utter astonishment, and continued long in prayer for the
                  assistance I have daily and hourly need from a crucified
                  <roleName>Savior</roleName>. Our dear father appears about
                  this time to have been tried with a <name type="health">delicate state of health</name>, sometimes <name type="health">suffering from new and affections</name>,
                  which had their bad effects upon his spirits. In <date>May
                     1806</date> he went to <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>, and
                  after midsummer the same year, he </p>

               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-07">7 </head>
               <p> he entered as a teacher with <placeName>Mirfield</placeName>
                  school. The next year he went to
                  <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>, to take charge of the Day
                  school there, but was soon again (<date>Sept 1808</date>)

                  for some years without a Laborer, and 
                  was in a very low condition, seeming
                  to require all the energy which health
                  and activity could supply. Here, as long

                  which he labored:”When at the close

                  imperfect services in the vineyard of 
                  our <roleName>Lord</roleName>, I see much cause for the

                  innurmerable transgressions,failings,
                  and short-comings, and fervently pray
                  my merciful <roleName>Saviour</roleName> and gracious

                  whether it be in the omission of my
                  duty, or in the performance of it in a

                  to give all the honor and glory to the <roleName>Lord</roleName>.
                  It is by his gracious assistance, I

                  In <placeName>Cootehill</placeName>,our dear Father’s
                  health quickly declined, and symp-
                  tons of those complicated diseases
                  began to show themselves, which
                  gradually affected almost every vi-
                  tal part, and mostly disabled him
                  from duty during the last six years
                  of his life. Soon after his first serious
                  attack, we find his experience recorded
                  thus:”In <date>the beginning of May 1841</date>,
                  I had a violent attack of <name type="health">influenza</name>
                  which lasted a long while, and caused
                  me to notice to rest early in the after-
                  noon. In the month of July I left
                  <placeName>Cootehill</placeName> for <placeName>Ballinderry</placeName> in hopes

                  service to me ; but this not being the
                  case, I begged my dismissal from ac-
                  tive Service in <placeName>Cootehill</placeName>, for I saw my- 
                  self necessitated to notice from the work
                  and labor of love in which my soul
                  delighted, by the severe Affliction by
                  with which a merciful and long-suf-
                  ferring Saviour visited me. I humbly,
                  bow down with submission to his bles-
                  sed will, and can say in this trial.
                  As I was enabled to do when lately
                  receiving the account of my dear Bro-
                  ther's departure: “It is the <roleName>lord</roleName>, let him
                  Do what seemeth him good.” I feel too
                  weak to participate deeply of the cup
                  of affiliation, and my dear Saviour
                  favors me, by permitting me to leave
                  all my griefs with him, and he con-
                  fonts me in such a manner that I can
                  not say I have had an hours real dis-
                  tress. After nearly 15 years labor amongst
                  the little flock at <placeName>Cootehill</placeName>,  having long
                  shared both joy and grief with them,
                  It is no wonder that I feel much at

                  on their behalf, shall be continued at
                  the throne of grace. In looking at the fu-

                  Dear <roleName>Lord</roleName> and Master should be pleased
                  to bless the means used for my recovery,
                  I may yet be employed in some part or
                  other of his vineyard, to bear still further
                  testimony of his great love to sinners. O
                  might I be more devoted to Him and
                  serve Him more faithfully till the end
                  of my days.”
                  In the course of some months, our father
                  thought himself sufficiently recovered
                  to assume his labors in <placeName>Cootehill</placeName>, and

                  till the following year <date>1845</date>. In April

                  tion of ending his days in the midst

                  sought change of air, and spent upwards

                  tion and Christian patience which he
                  presented to us. He did not converse
                  much on subjects of spiritual experi-

                  way he has done, since nothing else would have brot me so
                  closely to his feet. I have learnt more of the <name type="emotion">love</name> of <persName>Jesus</persName>,
                  in the <orgName>school of affliction</orgName>, than I ever
                  knew before, and I can rejoice in <persName>Christ
                     Jesus</persName> as my faithful helper in time of need, my
                  good <roleName>physician</roleName> and
                  <roleName>nurse</roleName>, and my merciful
                  <roleName>savior</roleName> who for forgiveth all my <name type="health">iniquities</name>. I have no confidence in
                  any other; in him alone I place my trust, and find him always
                  willing to help me. I <name type="emotion">delight</name> to
                  look to him by faith, and to think that though he is in the
                  brightness of his glory, he permits me a poor sinful creature
                  to behold him in His </p>

                  me <name type="emotion">resigned</name> and <name type="emotion">cheerful</name>. I have passed through years
                  of trial and <name type="health">suffering</name>, I have come
                  through great tribulation, yet I do not wish it had been less;
                  I am sure my <roleName>Savior</roleName> has proportioned this
                  chastisement to the necessities I neglected to bring me wholly
                  to himself, that I might see the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
                  be completely weaned from this present evil world, and live
                  solely to his praise and glory. Blessed be his name, he has in
                  a great measure affected his gracious purpose, and my <name type="emotion">joy</name> no man can take from me." In
                  another place he says: "The blessings I have <name type="emotion">enjoyed</name>, especially during the latter
                  part of my <name type="health">sufferings</name>, have been so
                  <name type="emotion">rich</name> and <name type="emotion">great</name>, that I have most sincerely thanked our
                  precious Savior <persName>Jesus</persName>, for visiting Me

               <p> me with this very affliction, since it has opened to me more

                  comparison between his own <name type="emotion">distress</name>, and the far greater and meritorious <name type="health">sufferings</name> of his
                  <roleName>Saviour</roleName>, he adds: "I know he <name type="emotion">loves</name> me and I <name type="emotion">love</name> him sincerely, but not as I ought. I can never
                  <name type="emotion">love</name> him here as I ought for

                  evident, that it was not the <roleName>Lord</roleName>'s will
                  to lengthen his life here, but to take him soon from <name type="health">tribulation</name> here below, to the <name type="emotion">pleasures</name> for even more at his right

                  stronger. He mentioned the ways which he used to sing _ And

                  there have I as vile as he, washed all my sins away. He said
                  he believed if he had seen this Gospel doctrine so clearly at
                  the time of his early ministry as he did now, his preaching
                  would, with the <roleName>Lord</roleName>'s blessing, have
                  been more effectual. His extreme <name type="health">weakness</name> had after led himself and others to think
